Superman,Eminem,2002,4716120.0,https://genius.com/Eminem-Superman-lyrics,"Dina Rae
They call me Superman
Leap tall hoes in a single bound
I'm single now: got no ring on this finger now
I'd never let another chick bring me down
In a relationship; save it, bitch!
Babysit? You make me sick
Superman ain't savin' shit
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase
I tell a muhfuckin' slut to her face
Play no games, say no names
Ever since I broke up with what's-her-face
I'm a different man, kiss my ass
What, you tryin' to be my new wife?
What, you Mariah? Fly through twice
But I do know one thing though
Bitches, they come, they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday (
Yeah-yeah
)
Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway, ho
'Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman
Don't get me wrong, I love these hoes
It's no secret, everybody knows
We'll be friends, I'll call you again
I'll chase you around every bar you attend
Never know what kinda car I'll be in
We'll see how much you'll be partyin' then
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway, ho
'Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman
'Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman
First thing you say:
""I'm not fazed, I hang around big stars all day
I don't see what the big deal is anyway
You're just plain old Marshall to me""
""Hailie Jade, I love that name
Love that tattoo, what's that say?
'Rot In Pieces', uh, that's great""
First off, you don't know Marshall
At all, so don't grow partial
There goes another lawsuit
Girl, you just blew your chance
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway, ho
'Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman
'Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman
'Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman
'Cause I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman"
Pussy Money Weed,Lil Wayne,2007,392937.0,https://genius.com/Lil-Wayne-Pussy-Money-Weed-lyrics,"Oh, yes, I love her, like Egyptian
She's ""Poison,"" and I am Michael Bivins
Smelling like the cologne that I put on this morn
I'm nasty as a Scorpio, but I'm a lucky Libra
Oh, yes, I love her like her dad told her no man would ever love her—oh, and
I better be the only man sticking it
Licking it like an envelope; mailing it, sealing it, read it
I have written down Victoria's Secret—don't tell nobody
Don't share your body with nobody—not even a finger
I will cut it off and let him keep it—that ass for Weezy, baby
And at my station, we have sex orientation
When I hit it, she squint like them Orient Asians; I do me
I say, ""Hey, Ms. Chun Li, I like to see your booty—
Roll, like sushi""; I'm tryna dip my celery up in her bleu cheese
""Ah""s, ""Ooh-wee""s
""Voila""s, ""Ta-da""s, ""Mhm""s, ""Uh-huh""s
""Oh, yeah""s, never ""Oh, no""s until I have to go
And then it's: ""Never! Oh, no!"" I tell her, ""Don't cry—
I be back like the electric bill""
And when she butt-naked, she dressed to kill"

Are you really gonna talk about timing in times like these?
And let all your damage damage me

You fire off missiles ’cause you hate yourself
But do you know you're demolishing me?
And then you squeeze my hand as I'm about to leave
And if I would've known
How sharp the pieces were you'd crumbled into
I might’ve let them lay
And make me your future history, it’s time"

They were just sixteen when the people were mean
So they didn't love themselves, and now they're gone
Headstones on a lawn
Best friends with each other, but always wished they were more
'Cause they loved one another, but never discovered
'Cause they were too afraid of what they'd say
Moved to different states
Oh, and I'm afraid that's just the way the world works
It ain't funny, it ain't pretty, it ain't sweet
Both our parents were evil
I was right
I wonder if she's alright
And the movie's always runnin' in my head
All the people, all the lovers, all my friends
And I hope that they all get their happy end
In the end
It's not the end of the story, hmm, hmm"

They just mad cause I beat the pussy like Bam Bam
Word to Skype, how I see it is how I call it dude
Thought you knew it's Red Lyfe, nigga we call it red if you call it blue

To beat me is like climbing mountains, the three peaks

Then we watch them stuff racks in they tip bag
I used to sell O's by the zip bag
Now we smoke fronto, not no zig zags

I hate when niggas use the internet to send a threat
FED's watching, so we ain't really into that
That's real shit, that's why these haters becoming like flies
All that hating and they still ain't paid, yet

Blue dye on my hands from all that money touching
Blue dye on my pants from all that money rubbing

Just don't let the devil take your good spirits from you
Just pray on it, stay focused keep your vision tunneled
I love my team, I swear it's like we move in a huddle
I don't let this shit affect me, I move in a bubble
'Til that thing go click like a seat buckle
Hold the ball, they rather see you fumble
I ain't tryna be funny but I get dough like a deal
But they don't understand controversy made me hot
So how the fuck think you the haters gon' make me stop
They forgot that Dr. Watkins post made me pop

I'm Schoolly D, you're Spoonie Gee

Happily married to rap and I'm glad that we buried

Trade my 4x4 for a G63, ain't no more free Lil Steve
I gave 'em chance and chance and chance again, I even done told them please
I find it crazy the police'll shoot you and know that you dead, but still tell you to freeze
Fucked up, I seen what I seen
I guess that mean hold him down if he say he can't breathe
It's too many mothers that's grieving
They killing us for no reason
Been going on for too long to get even
First I was drunk, then I sobered up quick
We just some products of our environment
How the fuck they gon' blame us?
Every colored person ain't dumb and all whites not racist
I be judging by the mind and heart, I ain't really into faces
I see blue lights, I get scared and start runnin'
That shit be crazy, they 'posed to protect us
Throw us in handcuffs and arrest us
While they go home at night, that shit messed up
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear
Corrupted police been the problem where I'm from
But I'd be lying if I said it was all of them
Altercations with the law, had a lot of them
I can't lie like I don't rap about killing and dope, but I'm telling my youngins to vote
I did what I did 'cause I didn't have no choice or no hope, I was forced to just jump in and go
This bullshit is all that we know, but it's time for a change
Got time to be serious, no time for no games
We ain't takin' no more, let us go from them chains
God bless they souls, every one of them names
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear
They trainin' officers to kill us, then shootin' protestors with these rubber bullets
What happened to COVID? Nobody remember
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here

You who dropped your dreams in the gutter""
And in my winter, she'll be burning slow
Feels like December knows me well
She said, ""Oh, I know that love is all about the wind
How it can hold me up and kill me in the end""
Still I loved it

Then at least I know I died a legend
I let these words seep through my soul
And speak through the song
'Cause if one day, I'm no longer here in the physical
Then at least I give you my voice to listen to

What is a beautiful mind, how is our beauty defined?

""Hey man, how's everything going brother? Oh, just taking it easy, hanging out with the old lady. Alright, God bless you, take it easy now, alright."" You be like that nigga ain't like that
You see him by himself, ""What's up Tony?"" ""Hey, where's the bitches at, nigga?! Where's the bitches?!""
Yeah
Gimme my space,
Lord, ain't enough time to chase
All these dreams, nah mean? I got no time to wait
Love my girl, but I told her straight up, ""Don't wait up""
we fucked and made up
Used to living free as a bird, but now I'm laid up
Feelin' like a nigga got handcuffs on
How the fuck did my life become a damn love song?
She ride for a nigga and she stand up for him
But a nigga wan' be a nigga, be a nigga
Ride through the streets with freaks and real niggas
She'll never understand what it's like to be a man
Knowin' when you look inside yourself you see a nigga
And you don't wan' let her down
But you too young for the settle down
And maybe you can thug it out
learn what is love about
When you can't live with her and you can't live without
Aw shit, goddamn, I think the devil got his hands on me
Stripper saying, ""Baby, won't you throw them bands on me?""
And I came to spend
She pop a molly, let the motherfuckin' games begin
Runaway, runaway
Runaway, runaway
I'm holdin' on
Desperately
Runaway, runaway
Runaway, runaway
I'm holdin' on
When it's all said and done everybody dies
In this life ain't no happy endings
Only pure beginnings followed by years of sinning and fake repentance
The preacher say we were made in image of Lord
To which I replied: ""Are you sure?
Even a murderer? Even a whore?
Even a nigga running through bitches on tour
With a good girl at home folding clothes and shit?""
She losin' faith in him and he knows the shit
Like, ""What the fuck is a break? Don't know how much I can take no more
I give you all I got 'til it ain't no more
No more tears, it's been ten long years
Damn near, I don't know if I can wait no more""
And who can blame her, you complain about
Every time you out
you come back she poutin'
Sleeping back to back, this is wack
we 'bout
To go platinum and I'm in the crib acting out
My childhood fantasies of wife and home
But it's a whole lot of actresses I'd like to bone
And despite the rumors you hold out
On account of your guilt
and she has got to spend her nights alone
And she ride or die like Eve and 'em
Make home-cooked meals every evenin'
And even in your lowest days
When you're no longer Superman, at least you know you got Lois Lane
But you
Runaway, runaway

Unbelievable, seen evil that not even Knievel know
At age three I knew this world was three below
Listen, even though my ego low, achieved the unachievable
Imagine if my confidence was halfway decent yo
This just in, fucked more bitches than Bieber though
Still I keep it low, got my niggas on the need to know
Basis
my manager back in the days was racist
I was a young boy, passing skates and tucking laces
Old perverted white man who told me, ""Jermaine
It's all pink on the inside, fuck what color they face is""
Wise words from an indecent man
Made me reflect on the times when we was three-fifths of them
In chains and powerless, brave souls reduced to cowardice
Slaving in the baking sun for hours just
To see the master creep into the shack where your lady at
Nine months later got a baby, that's
Not quite what you expected, but you
Refuse to neglect it, 'cause you
Know your wifey loves you
thus you refuse to accept it
That’s the type of shit that turned my granny light-skinned
Rich white men rule the nation still
Only difference is we all slaves now
the chains concealed
In our thoughts,
if I follow my heart to save myself
Could I run away from fifty-mill like Dave Chappelle?

You build walls, we gon' prolly dig holes

We the people of this country
We got a voice too
We will be seen

If he's black, he's probably armed, you see him and shoot
And tryna help a lady cross the road to have her walkin' off
Look, black ain't just a single fuckin' colour, man, there's shades to it
Black is distant, it's representin' countries that never even existed while your grandmother was livin'
Doin' research on his lineage, findin' out that he's Egyptian
Black is people namin' your countries on what they trade most
Coast of Ivory, Gold Coast, and the Grain Coast
West Africa, Benin, they called it slave coast
They take our features when they want and have their fun with it
Never seem to help with all the things we know would come with it

Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
People call, say ""Beware, doll, you're bound to fall""
You thought they were all a-kiddin' you
You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hangin' out
Now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging your next meal
How does it feel?
How does it feel
To be without a home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?
Aw, you've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely
But ya know ya only used to get juiced in it
Nobody's ever taught ya how to live out on the street
And now you’re gonna have to get used to it
You say you never compromise
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say, “Do you want to make a deal?""
With no direction home
A complete unknown
Aw, you never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you
Never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you
You used to ride on a chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything he could steal?
To hang on your own
With no direction home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?
Aw, princess on the steeple and all the pretty people
They're all drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made
Exchangin' all precious gifts
But you'd better take your diamond ring, ya better pawn it, babe
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags, and the language that he used
When ya ain't got nothin', you got nothin' to lose
You're invisible now, ya got no secrets to conceal
To be on your own"

I wanna find something I've wanted all along
Somewhere I belong
And the fault is my own, and the fault is my own
I will never know myself until I do this on my own
And I will never feel anything else until my wounds are healed
I will never be anything 'til I break away from me
I will break away, I'll find myself today
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
What I thought was never real
I wanna let go of the pain I've held so long
Erase all the pain 'til it's gone
I wanna heal, I wanna feel
Like I'm close to something real
I wanna find something I've wanted all along

Do a little spring cleanin'
I'm always too busy dreamin'
Well, maybe I should wake up instead
Why can't it just be easy?
Why does everybody need me to stay?
When you're high, but you're underneath the ceilin'
Got the cards in my hand, I hate dealin', yeah
Can I get a break?
I wish that I could just get out my goddamn way
What is there to say?
There ain't a better time than today
Well, maybe I'll lay down for a little, yeah
Instead of always tryin' to figure everything out
And all I do is say sorry
Half the time I don't even know what I'm sayin' it about
Good news, good news, good news
That's all they wanna hear
No, they don't like it when I'm down
But when I'm flyin', oh
It make 'em so uncomfortable
So different, what's the difference?
I'm runnin' out of gas, hardly anything left
Hope I make it home from work
Well, so tired of bein' so tired
I'm no liar, but
Sometimes the truth don't sound like the truth
Maybe 'cause it ain't
I just love the way it sound when I say it
Wake up to the moon, haven't seen the sun in a while
But I heard that the sky's still blue, yeah
I heard they don't talk about me too much no more
And that's the problem with a closed door
Good news, good news, good news
That's all they wanna hear
No, they don't like it when I'm down
But when I'm flyin', oh
It make 'em so uncomfortable
So different, what's the difference?
There's a whole lot more for me waitin' on the other side
I'm always wonderin' if it feel like summer
I know maybe I'm too late, I could make it there some other time
That there's a whole lot more for me waitin'
That there's a whole lot more for me waitin'
Then I'll finally discover
That it ain't that bad, ain't so bad
Well, it ain't that bad, mm
At least it don't gotta be no more"

The loud screams that seek me out
My hand, trophy and a gold microphone
All day, everywhere
But all of this is about reaching you
It's the answer to my journey
I'm singing to find you
Baby to you
This eternal night with no end in sight
It's you who gifted me the morning

Now is the climax to the story
That gives the demons and angels purpose
They fly around while we are walking
And mold our emotions just to please them
I am cold, can you hear?
I will fly with no hope, no fear
And the ground taunts my wings
Plummet as I sing
Plummet as I sing
All we are is an isle of flightless birds
We find our worth in giving birth and stuff
We're lining our homes against winding roads
And we think the going is tough
We pick songs to sing
Remind us of things that nobody cares about
And honestly, we're probably
More suicidal than ever now
If you decide to live by
What you think's wrong and what's right
Believe me, you'll begin to wish you were sleeping
Your weeping will creep in your head and you'll cry
But if we wake up every morning
And decide what we believe
We can take apart our very heart
And the light will set us free
I am cold, can you hear?
I will fly with no hope, no fear
And the ground taunts my wings
Plummet as I sing, plummet as I
I am cold, can you hear?
I will fly with no hope, no fear
And the ground taunts my wings
Plummet as I sing, plummet as I
How frustrating and so degrading
His time, we're wasting
as time will fly by
And the sky will cry as light is fading
And He is waiting, oh, so patiently
While we repeat the same routine as we will please comfortability
And please think about why you can't sleep, uh, in the evening
And please don't be afraid of what your soul is really thinking
Your soul knows good and evil, your soul knows both sides
And it's time you pick your battle
And I promise you, this is mine
(I promise you, this is mine)"

had to battle young padawans all the damn day
I'm getting naked and I'm hopping on a wrecking ball
So hot, I got the motherfucker
a la flambé
I go to Miley's house, I see that Miley's home
I play Miley's ribcage with my dick, like it's a Xylie-phone
but my skills are highly honed
And if I was highly hyphy, I might be more widely-known

, better pay my fee
They kick it in Seattle in a Patagonia jacket
They get it in the Bay in a plain white tee
Hey mami! You a P.Y.T

I bend it then I break it then I chop it then I eat it up
And PETA would never approve of the way

In a moment, I'll be taking off a tourniquet
When I burn them and I hit them in the sternum
I don't even got to enter, but I'm gonna win the tournament
That's what I'm all about
And I hope that it would have been the end of it and I'm out
But they never tend to give me the benefit of the doubt
Ever since I was a little kid
I know that I've been looking for the hot, hot spotlight
And if you really wonder what I think about the competition
They were not-not-not tight
I've been reading my scripture
Every photo bomber wanna be in my picture
And you better bet I'm living every single day
Like it's the motherfucking Catalina Wine Mixer
Bada bing, bada boom!
When I walk in, I'm the king of the room
And I get it locked in like a king in a tomb
When I spit a toxin and they cough on the fumes
Cause I'm back in the nick of time and attacking the fickle mind
I'm a jackal, I'll rip his hide, I'ma tackle him, pick a fight
I be Dracula, set to bite
in the black of the bitter night

Macbeth Act 1 Scene 5,William Shakespeare,1611,304866.0,https://genius.com/William-Shakespeare-Macbeth-Act-1-Scene-5-lyrics,"Macbeth's castle.
LADY MACBETH
'They met me in the day of success: and I have
learned by the perfectest report, they have more in
them than mortal knowledge.
When I burned in
desire
to question them further, they made themselves air,
into which they vanished.
Whiles I stood rapt in
the wonder of it, came missives from the king
who
all-hailed me
'Thane of Cawdor
by which title,
before, these weird sisters saluted me, and referred
me to the coming on of time, with 'Hail, king that
shalt be!'
This have I thought good to deliver
thee, my dearest partner of greatness,
that thou
mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being
ignorant of what greatness is promised thee.
Lay it
to thy heart, and farewell.
Glamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be
What thou art promised:
yet do I fear thy nature;
It is too full o' the milk of human kindness
To catch the nearest way:
thou wouldst be great;
Art not without ambition, but without
The illness should attend it:
what thou wouldst highly,
That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,
And yet wouldst wrongly win:
thou'ldst have, great Glamis,
That which cries 'Thus thou must do, if thou have it;
And that which rather thou dost fear to do
Than wishest should be undone.
Hie thee hither,
That I may pour my spirits in thine ear;
And chastise with the valour of my tongue
All that impedes thee from the golden round,
Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem
To have thee crown'd withal.
What is your tidings?
Thou'rt mad to say it:
Is not thy master with him? who, were't so,
Would have inform'd for preparation.
So please you, it is true: our thane is coming:
One of my fellows had the speed of him,
Who, almost dead for breath, had scarcely more
Than would make up his message.
LADY MACBETH
Give him tending;
He brings great news.
The raven himself is hoarse
That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan
Under my battlements.
Come, you spirits
That tend on
mortal thoughts
unsex me here,
And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full
Of direst cruelty! make thick my blood;
Stop up the access and passage to remorse,
That no compunctious visitings of nature
Shake my fell purpose,
nor keep peace between
The effect and it!
Come to my woman's breasts,
And take my milk for gall, you murdering ministers,
Wherever in your sightless substances
You wait on nature's mischief!
Come, thick night,
And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell,
That my keen knife see not the wound it makes,
Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark,
To cry 'Hold, hold!'
Enter MACBETH
Great Glamis! worthy Cawdor!
Greater than both, by the all-hail hereafter!
Thy letters have transported me beyond
This ignorant present, and I feel now
The future in the instant.
My dearest love,
Duncan comes here to-night.
And when goes hence?
To-morrow, as he purposes.
O, never
Shall sun that morrow see!
Your face, my thane, is as a book where men
May read strange matters.
To beguile the time,
Look like the time; bear welcome in your eye,
Your hand, your tongue:
look like the innocent flower,
But be the serpent under't.
He that's coming
Must be provided for:
and you shall put
This night's great business into my dispatch;
Which shall to all our nights and days to come
Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom.
We will speak further.
Only look up clear;
To alter favour ever is to fear:
Leave all the rest to me.
Exeunt"

All up in the blogs saying we met at the bar
When I don't even know who you are
Saying we up in your house, saying I'm up in your car
But you in LA, and I'm out at Jermaine's
I'm up in the A, you so, so lame
And no one here even mentions your name
It must be the weed, it must be the E
'Cause you be popping, heard you get it popping
Why you so obsessed with me? Boy, I wanna know
Lying that you're sexing me, when everybody knows
It's clear that you're upset with me, oh
It's confusing, yo, you're confused, you know
Why you wasting your time?
Got you all fired up with your Napoleon complex
See right through you like you're bathing in Windex
You on your job, you hating hard
Ain't gon' feed you, I'ma let you starve
Grasping for air, I'm ventilation
You out of breath, hope you ain't waiting
Telling the world how much you miss me
But we never were, so why you tripping?
You a mom and pop, I'm a corporation
I'm the press conference, you a conversation
Why you so obsessed with me? And boy, I wanna know
Lying that you're sexing me, when everybody knows
It's clear that you're upset with me, oh
Got you all fired up with your Napoleon complex
See right through you like you're bathing in Windex
(Hey, he's all up in my George Foreman)
Why you so obsessed with me? Boy, I wanna know
Lying that you're sexing me, when everybody knows
(Lying that you're sexing Mimi)
It's clear that you're upset with me, oh (Eh)

Talk to you and make you understand

And just as you halt and you turn and you start to leave

[Intro]
Stadium status
My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
Who was Hip Hop brother,
who was No I.D. friend
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin
It's the
Hard Knock Life
 Tour, sellout
Picture us in the mall, coppin' Iceberg and yell out ""Jigga""
Yeah, that's what we'll yell out, yell out
You know the name do I gotta spell out or tell 'bout
J-A-Y,
But he got me out my momma crib
Then he help me get my momma a crib
Big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
Who was Hip Hop brother,
who was No I.D. friend
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin, begin
Let the story begin
Fresh off the plane, I'm off to Baseline
'Round the same time of that
Blueprint 1
And these beats in my pocket was that blueprint for him
I'd play my little songs in that old back room
He'd bob his head and say ""Damn! Oh, that's you?""
But by
The Black Album
, I was blacking out
Partyin' S.O.B.'s and we had packed a crowd
Big brother got his show up at Madison Square
And I'm like ""Yeah, yeah, we gon' be there"" but
Not only did I not get a chance to spit it
Carline told me I could buy two tickets
I guess big brother was thinkin' a little different
And kept little brother at bay, at a distance
But everything that I felt was more bogus
Only made me more focused, only wrote more potent
Only thing I wanna know is why I get looked over
I guess I'll understand when I get more older
Big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem
Now I'm on the top and everybody on the scrotum
My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
Who was Hip Hop brother,
who was No I.D. friend
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin, begin
Let the story begin
Not only a client, the Presidito,
hola, Hovito
The game gettin' foul so here's a free throw
Then I dropped ""Jesus Walks"" now I'm on the steeple
And we know, ""New Jack City""—got to keep my brother
On that ""Diamonds"" remix I swore I spazzed
Then my big brother came through and kicked my ass
Sibling rivalry, only I could see
It was the pride in me that was drivin' me
At the Grammys I said, ""I inspired me""
But my big brother who I always tried to be
When I kicked a flow it was like pick-and-roll
'Cause even if he gave me the rock, it's give-and-go
I guess Beanie's style was more of a slam dunk
And my shit was more like a finger roll
I told Jay I did a song with Coldplay
Next thing I know he got a song with Coldplay
Back in my mind I'm like, ""Damn, no way""
Then I went and told Jay Brown
Shoulda known that was gon' come back around
Shoulda talked to you like a man, shoulda told you first
But I told somebody else and that's what made shit worse
My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
So here's a few words from ya kid brother
If you admire somebody you should go on 'head tell 'em
People never get the flowers while they can still smell 'em
A idol in my eyes, god of the game
Heart of the City
Roc-a-Fella chain
My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
Who was Hip Hop brother,
who was No I.D. friend
No I.D., my mentor, and that's where the story ends

Your shit pushed back cause it ain't buzzin'
Now these thugs actors all of a sudden
Can't talk snow, where the soft at?
Your man got murked but you squashed that
Hope you know what we call that
I think you know just what we call that...
Platinum 21, it's time to go and spoil shorty
You only live once
I'm screamin' YOLO in the V-I
Atlanta housewives takin' pictures in my section
Huh! A hundred mil ain't enough
Got a hundred women, gotta deal with it, love
Worth forty Ms, is he still dealin' drugs?
Cigarette speedboats but he's still with the thugs
Club LIV, Louis shots on a Sunday
Order some more bottles because I'm on one
She wanna cum, maybe come over
Stop dealin' with them niggas, you need one soldier"

Floating through different dimensions
But not losing sense of religion
Honey, I forgot to mention

Demons,Imagine Dragons,2012,1870301.0,https://genius.com/Imagine-Dragons-Demons-lyrics,"When the days are cold and the cards all fold
And the saints we see are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
Are the worst of all, and the blood's run stale
I wanna hide the truth, I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
At the curtain's call it's the last of all
When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you've made
Don't wanna let you down, but I am hell-bound
Though this is all for you, don't wanna hide the truth
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
They say it's what you make, I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul, I need to let you go
Your eyes, they shine so bright, I wanna save that light
I can't escape this now, unless you show me how
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide"

Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

For the Devil sends the beast with wrath
Because he knows the time is short
Let him who hath understanding reckon the number of the beast
For it is a human number
Its number is six hundred and sixty-six
I left alone, my mind was blank
I needed time to think, to get the memories from my mind
What did I see? Can I believe
That what I saw that night was real and not just fantasy?
Cos in my dreams, it's always there
The evil face that twists my mind and brings me to despair
Yeah
Night was black, was no use holding back
Cos I just had to see, was someone watching me?
In the mist, dark figures move and twist
Was all this for real, or just some kind of hell?
Six-six-six, the number of the beast
Hell and fire was spawned to be released
In the night, the fires are burning bright
Six-six-six, the number of the beast
Sacrifice is going on tonight
But I feel drawn towards the chanting hordes
Seem to mesmerize, can't avoid the eyes
Six-six-six, the number of the beast
Six-six-six, the one for you and me
I'm coming back, I will return
And I'll possess your body and I'll make you burn
I have the fire, I have the force
I have the power to make my evil take its course"

Cause I had a yellow bone that could've come from out the Simpsons
But fuck it I'm on a mission
Flight delayed like 30 minutes, now that's the shit that I hate
Now it's eight thirty, I'm officially late, for that eight o'clock spot
I know the Program Director hot
But I spit a freestyle up in there so cold
That everybody in that bitch forgot,
Um, alright, it's that young renegade, man they been afraid
Um, I'm like a young black Eminem
It's a riddle and I'm repping that Michigan
Tryna stack my dividends, get my mom a new crib and them
And a bunch of synonyms about how he was living and I even let him finish it
I mean I can't lie he was alright, but at his age, shit so was I
Shorty: Bet, He short as hell though
Hahahaha
But when the world drives you out, and your gas tank is on E
I know you're not my child talking like that."

Had so many bottles, gave ugly girl a sip
Out the window of the Benzo, we get seen in the rent'

Boolin' with a thot-thot, she gon' give me top-top
Just one switch, I can make the ass drop (Hey)
Ayy, take you to the smoke shop
We gon' get high, ayy, we gon' hit Rodeo
Dial up Valentino, we gon' hit Pico
Take you where I'm from, take you to the slums
This ain't happen overnight, no, these diamonds real bright
Saint Laurent jeans, still in my Vans, though
All VVS', put you in a necklace
Girl, you look beautiful tonight
Stars on the roof, they're matching with the jewelry

Why iii Love The Moon.,Phony Ppl,2015,225929.0,https://genius.com/Phony-Ppl-Why-iii-Love-The-Moon-lyrics,"Real love's so hard to find
Just when you think you've found it
That's why I love the moon
Every night it's there for you
It's constant
Unlike these human beings
Who lie about what it seems to be
You think the Earth is where you stand
You're in the palm of someone's hand
And that's why I love the moon, yeah
Because people can consume my love
In the wrong way
So I send it up
At night, at night, at night
Real love's so hard to find
Just when you think you've found it
Real love's so hard to find
Just when you think you've found it
You see it's no change droppin' we learn to maintain profit
And how could anybody else feel pain when they brainwash us?
And watch us every time we make exchanges (We slaves)
Locked in a box, we use our mind just to escape all the same shit
Peace to the moon
Peace to the stars
Peace to Saturn
And peace to Mars"

Deen Buck still in the cut and the state fittin' to let Ernie out
I ain't even gotta say nothin'
'Bout that other homie that you heard about

Fuck the judge, let 9 out, hairpin trigger, let 9 out
Four birds in the trap like four wings at Harold’s
With fries covered in mild sauce
Everytime a nigga rap beef, get clapped up in a couple weeks
IG comments and a couple tweets
Location on, we can go and meet
Headshot, I'm outta town, I'm in Killadelphia with my nigga Meek
Pop a wheelie in N-Y-C, I got the 30 on with my nigga Flee
Heard Tyga sneak dissin' on me, tellin thot bitches I'm not right
Tyga only got one name, but that nigga ain't got one stripe
He backpack,
Ask Mally Mall to get his shit back
In Chiraq, don't come here
You ain't from here? Don't come here
No Young Chop, that .40 bangs just like him
Fuck I gotta rap for, got bricks
Every city I go, got sticks
Pockets Wells Fargo, no bricks

New York SlowBucks, them my brothers
A-T-L with Migos and Young Thugger
Chiraq, look at the murder rate
500 dead bodies, better go and get money 'fore you be on first 48
You wear red bottoms

Hangin’ out the tank with Slow and them
Come take a trip to D.C.
Hear a lot of Me and see GG
I’m the big dog, I’m ringin’ off
Like Mambo Sauce on a 3 piece
“Glizzy, why you ain’t D.C.?""
Who said I ain’t D.C.?
Fuck ya bitch to my CD
She let me record her like Mimi
Ooh, shine got me iced out
Can't wait 'til it get nice out
Tell Chino bring the bikes out
Got 50 guns in my trap house

Keep the 30 on me like I'm Stephen Curry

We gon' ride past with that iron blast
And start flipping niggas like Jessie White

And I'm fucking monster in a pair of Mike's and this 40 on me looks very nice
Hoodie on like a monk, I'm Boyz-N-Tha-Hood with that pump

That money be callin', I won't stop ballin', now I am up next like Jabari now
Show you what I'm saying like closed captions
I'll put the chopper to a nigga top, and then let it fly, Go-Go Gadget
If a fuck nigga ever jump stupid, I'ma catch a body like a trampoline
Bitch I'm Freddy Kruger in a hockey mask
Ask a nigga where he hide his stash
He better tell the truth like a polygraph
Leave a nigga stiff like a body cast
And we don't know nothing about nothing nigga, we was out of town If somebody ask

If I ain't gone, I ain't home, I ain't them, I ain't them

Lovin' life above a reason, just can't find it like a dozen people

Might heal everybody around me, how the wind blow
Open your window, let the debris in, never let me in
Maybe if I could live hundred years, that be real
Pay me if I'ma be rhymin' these homonyms
Crazy, my other show went to my mama 'nem
My daddy said a Mercedes had haunted him
But now he got one, I'm ridin' shotgun
With a three-piece chicken dinner and shotgun
And I believe in Kool-Aid and God's son
Do you believe that Black man is our sun?
I told Zay I'm the best rapper since twenty-five
Been like that for a while now, I'm twenty-nine
Any nigga that disagree is a fuckin' liar
Pardon me, see my alter ego a Gemini
Him and I been around ever since Reagan was criticized
Might stay in the Trump Tower for one week
Spray paint all the walls and smoke weed
Fuck them and fuck y'all and fuck me
To fix the blocks we on, to right my wrongs
The word to give the life we live as I get
So ahead of myself

When I was just learning to stand without a helping hand
Damn, was it my fault, something I did
To make a father leave his first kid at seven doin' my first bid? (Ugh)
Back on the scene at fourteen with a scheme (Ugh)
To get more cream than I'd ever seen in a dream (Ugh)
And by all means I will be livin' high off the hog (What)
Didn't need a clique 'cause I scared a nigga that much
One deep with the pit startin' shit for kicks
Catchin' vics, throwin' bricks, gettin' by bein' slick
I'm possessed by the darker side, livin' the cruddy life
Shit like this kept a nigga with a bloody knife
Wanna make records but I'm fuckin' it up
I'm slippin', I'm fallin', I can't get up
Wasn't long before I hit rock bottom
Niggas talkin' shit, like, ""Damn, look how that rock got him!""
Somethin's got to give, gots to change 'cause now I've got a son
I gots to do the right thing for shorty
And that means no more gettin' high, drinkin' 40s"

I sold my soul, I'm waiting for my pay in full
I feel left out, I don't see how
My whole life can change in one week
I don't mind my own reflection
I tried, but I don't think so
Maybe it was me who was fucking up
I gave all I could give, but
It seems like it never really was enough
I changed my whole life when
I learned to ignore them
I changed my whole life up
Maybe it was not enough

Make a deal with your selfish ways"
Pure Comedy,Father John Misty,2017,298185.0,https://genius.com/Father-John-Misty-Pure-Comedy-lyrics,"At six-
For some reason when I go to the app...
The comedy of man starts like this:
Our brains are way too big for our mothers' hips
And so nature, she devised this alternative:
We emerge half-formed and hope whoever greets us on the other end
Is kind enough to fill us in
And babies, that's pretty much how it's been ever since
Now the miracle of birth leaves a few issues to address
Like, say, that half of us are periodically iron deficient
So somebody's gotta go kill something while I look after the kids
I'd do it myself, but what, are you gonna to get this thing its milk?
He says as soon as he gets back from the hunt, we can switch
It's hard not to fall in love with something so helpless
Ladies, I hope we don't end up regretting this
Comedy, now that's what I call pure comedy
Just wait until the part where they start to believe
They're at the center of everything
And some all-powerful being
Endowed this horror show with meaning
Oh, their religions are the best
They worship themselves yet they're totally obsessed
With risen zombies, celestial virgins, magic tricks
These unbelievable outfits
And they get terribly upset
When you question their sacred texts
Written by woman-hating epileptics
Their languages just serve to confuse them
Their confusion somehow makes them more sure
They build fortunes poisoning their offspring
And hand out prizes when someone patents a cure
Where did they find these goons they elected to rule them?
What makes these clowns they idolize so remarkable?
These mammals are hell-bent on fashioning new gods
So they can go on being godless animals
Oh comedy, their illusions they have no choice but to believe
Their horizons that just forever recede
And how's this for irony:
Their idea of being free is a prison of beliefs
That they never ever have to leave
Oh comedy, oh it's like something that a madman would conceive!
The only thing that seems to make them feel alive
Is the struggle to survive
But the only thing that they request
Is something to numb the pain with
Until there's nothing human left
Just random matter suspended in the dark
I hate to say it, but each other's all we've got"

With words that I should have said
As I drown in my regrets
I can't take back the words I never said
I can't take back the words I never said
I really think the War on Terror is a bunch of bullshit
Just a poor excuse for you to use up all your bullets
How much money does it take to really make a full clip?
9/11, building 7, did they really pull it?
Uh, and a bunch of other coverups
If you think that hurts, then wait, here comes the uppercut
The school was garbage in the first place, that's on the up and up
Keep you at the bottom but tease you with the upper crust
If you turn on TV, all you see's a bunch of what-the-fucks
Dude is dating so and so, blabbering 'bout such and such
And that ain't Jersey Shore, homie, that's the news
And these the same people supposedly telling us the truth
Limbaugh is a racist, Glenn Beck is a racist
Gaza Strip was getting bombed, Obama didn't say shit
That's why I ain't vote for him, next one either
I'm a part of the problem, my problem is I'm peaceful
And I believe in the people, yeah
It's so loud inside my head

As I drown in my regrets
I can't take back the words I never said
Jihad is not holy war, where's that in the worship?
Murdering is not Islam, and you are not observant
And you are not a Muslim
Israel don't take my side 'cause look how far you've pushed them
Walk with me into the ghetto, this where all the kush went
Complain about the liquor store, but what you drinking liquor for?
Complain about the gloom, but when'd you pick a broom up?
Just listening to Pac ain't gon' make it stop
A rebel in your thoughts ain't gon' make it halt
If you don't become a actor, you'll never be a factor
Pills with million side effects, take 'em when the pain's felt
Wash 'em down with diet soda, killing off your brain cells
Crooked banks around the world would gladly give a loan today
So if you ever miss a payment, they can take your home away
It's so loud inside my head
With words that I should have said
As I drown in my regrets
I can't take back the words I never said, never said
I can't take back the words I never said
We scared of almost everything, afraid to even tell the truth
I'm locked inside a cell in me, I know that there's a jail in you
Consider this your bailing out, so take a breath, inhale a few
It's so loud inside my head
With words that I should have said
As I drown in my regrets
I can't take back the words I never said"

Well, it don't really matter, 'cause I'm killin' this shit
Yeah, I'm killin' this shit
Oh yeah, oh yeah, I'm killin' this shit
Bobby, how many times you been killin' this shit?

Fuck rap
Bustin' like an addict with a semi-automatic
Who done had it, and he ready for anybody to buck back
Hold up, catch a vibe, ain't no way in hell we leavin' nobody alive
Leave a suicide note, fuck that
Bobby feelin' villainous, he killin' this
I'm comin' for your man and his lady and even the baby
I'm feelin' like I'm, chika-chika-chika-chika

I got bitches, I got hoes, I got rare designer clothes
No, we ain't fuckin' with that
Yeah, there's a time and a place
But if you ain't comin' with the illest of raps
Callin' yourself the greatest alive
Then you don't deserve to do that
No, no, oh no, no, please do not do that
You gon' make Bobby attack
You gon' make Bobby Boy snap
You gon' make Bobby Boy snap (Bobby Boy!)
Fuck rap

Jigga-jigga-jigga-jigga-jigga like JAY-Z
Jig is up, you fuckers who didn't write anything
Are getting washed, liga-liga-liga, like bathing
Young Hova, I know hitters like Yankees
Gun toters that pull triggers like crazy
Unloadin', leave you shot up in your Rover
Your body goes limp and slumps over
Like A-Rod in a month lull, but he just homered
Hol' up, I said ""Rover"" because now your Rover is red
Like Red Rover, so you know what I meant
But I roll over my opponents instead
Makin' dog sounds 'cause I gotta keep breakin' these bars down
I'll go slow for the speds
But when I go (Roof!) like the Dobermann said
I still think the (Roof!) would go over your head (Ha-ha)
Beast mode, motherfuckers 'bout to get hit
With so many foul lines, you'll think I'm a free throw
Figured it was about time for people to eat crow
You about to get out-rhymed, how could I be dethroned?
I stay on my toes like the repo, a behemoth in sheep's clothes
From the East Coast to the West, I'm the ethos and I'm the GOAT
Who the best, I don't gotta say a fuckin' thing, though
'Cause MCs know
But you don't wanna hear me spit the facts
Your shit is ass like a tailbone
Or you're trapped in your cell phone
Or my chicken scratch, or my self-loathe
I don't wanna fuckin' listen to you spit your raps someone else wrote
Used to get beat up by the big kids
Used to let the big kids steal my big wheel
And I wouldn't do shit but just sit still
Now money's not a big deal
I'm rich, I wipe my ass with six mill'
Big bills like a platypus
A caterpillar's comin' to get the cannabis
Man, I can see my dick is standin' stiff as a mannequin
And I'm bringin' the bandana back, and the fuckin' headband again
A handkerchief and I'm thinkin' of bringin' the fuckin' fingerless gloves back
And not giving a singular fuck, like fuck rap
I sound like a fuckin' millionaire
With a Derringer with a hair trigger
'Bout to bear hug a fuckin' terrier, the Ric Flair dripper
Y'all couldn't hold a candle at a prayer vigil
When I vent, they compare me to a fuckin' air duct
The track is the blood, I'm attracted, I'm attackin' it
What? Dracula, fuck that shit
Man, stop
Look what I'm plannin', plannin', I'm plannin' to
Do all this while ya panickin'
And you're lookin' and starin' at mannequins
And I'm goin' to Fanagans
Trying to get up a plan against
All of the blana-kazana-ka-fam-bam-bannigans
While of all the bana-kazanika Hanna in a cabana
You're in a cab-
I'm in a cabana and a Janet
I'm in a cabana chantin' all this standup banter
While you don't got the stamina, you're lackin' the stamina
You're lackin' the stamina while you're divorcin' Harrison Ford
And I'm in a Porsche on the floorboards
While I'm world tourin'
You usin' way too many napkins, papkins
Lapkins and chapki-
You using ChapStick and napkins while I'm bapkin'
Flappin' around like a bapkin'

We go back to your house
You check the charts
And start to figure it out
And if it's crowded, all the better
Because we know we're gonna be up late
But if you're worried about the weather
Then you picked the wrong place to stay
That's how it starts
And so it starts
You switch the engine on
We set controls for the heart of the sun
One of the ways that we show our age
And if the sun comes up, if the sun comes up
If the sun comes up and I still don't wanna stagger home
Then it's the memory of our betters
That are keeping us on our feet
You spent the first five years trying to get with the plan
And the next five years trying to be with your friends again
Oh, you're talking forty-five turns just as fast as you can
Yeah, I know it gets tired, but it's better when we pretend
It comes apart
The way it does in bad films
Though when we're running out of the drugs
And the conversation's grinding away
I wouldn't trade one stupid decision
For another five years of life
you drop the first ten years just as fast as you can
And the next ten people who are trying to be polite
When you're blowing eighty-five days in the middle of France
Yeah, I know it gets tired, only where are your friends tonight?
And to tell the truth
Oh, this could be the last time
So here we go
Like a sales force into the night
And if I made a fool, if I made a fool
If I made a fool on the road, there's always this
And if I'm sued into submission
I can still come home to this
And with a face like a dad and a laughable stand
You can sleep on the plane or review what you said
When you're drunk and the kids look impossibly tanned
You think over and over, ""Hey, I'm finally dead""
Oh, if the trip and the plan come apart in your hand
You can turn it on yourself, you ridiculous clown
You'll forget what you meant when you read what you said
And yeah, we knew you were tired, but then
Where are your friends tonight?
Where are your friends tonight?
Where are your friends tonight?
If I could see all my friends tonight
If I could see all my friends tonight

She got the scars, they serve as reminders
Blood still on her pajamas

Back, back, way back I used to front like Angkor Wat
Mechanicsburg,
Anchorage
and Dar es Salaam
While home in New York was champagne and disco
Tapes from L.A. slash San Francisco
But actually Oakland and not Alameda
Your girl was in Berkeley with her Communist reader
Mine was entombed within boombox and Walkman
I was a hoarder, but girl, that was back then
The gloves are off,
the wisdom teeth are out
What you on about?
I feel it in my bones
I feel it in my bones
I'm stronger now, I'm ready for the house
Such a modest mouse
I can't do it alone
I can't do it alone
Every time I see you in the world
You always step to my girl
Ancestors told me that their girl was better
She's richer than Croesus,
she's tougher than leather
I just ignore all the tales of her past life
Stale conversation deserves but a bread knife
And punks who would laugh when they saw us together
Well, they didn't know how to dress for the weather
I can still see them there, huddled on Astor
Snow falling slow to the sound of the master
The gloves are off,
the wisdom teeth are out

I feel it in my bones
I'm stronger now, I'm ready for the house
Such a modest mouse
I can't do it alone

Wisdom's a gift, but you'd trade it for youth
Age is an honor, it's still not the truth
We saw the stars when they hid from the world
You cursed the sun when it stepped to your girl
Maybe she's gone and I can't resurrect her
The truth is she doesn't need me to protect her
We know the true death, the true way of all flesh
Everyone's dying, but girl, you're not old yet
Gloves are off,
the wisdom teeth are out
What you on about?
I feel it in my bones
I feel it in my bones
I'm stronger now, I'm ready for the house
Such a modest mouse
I can't do it alone
I can't do it alone
Gloves are off,
the wisdom teeth are out
What you on about?
I feel it in my bones
I feel it in my bones
I'm stronger now, I'm ready for the house

Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said
When I met you on the outskirts of town and I said

""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone

Episode 6: The Case Against Adnan Syed,Serial Podcast,2014,255428.0,https://genius.com/Serial-Podcast-Episode-6-The-Case-Against-Adnan-Syed-lyrics,"So, it’s just, it’s a really tight, really window of time I mean, for this to have taken place, right?
Isn’t that sort of tantamount to saying ‘I think Jay’s telling the truth?’
Leakin
The most incriminating piece of physical evidence against Adnan Syed was a fingerprint
, or rather, a palm print.
It was one of those big map books you buy at a gas station, police found it in the backseat of Hae’s car. On the back cover was a partial print of Adnan’s left palm.
At trial they pointed out that it was the page that showed Leakin Park.
The defense argued, ‘well, you can’t put a timestamp on fingerprints, they could’ve been six week-old fingerprints or six month-old fingerprints, there’s no way to tell.’ And Adnan had ridden in and driven Hae’s car many times, all their friends said
so.
The ripped out page showed a whole lot more than just Leakin Park. In fact, it showed their whole neighborhood, the school, the malls, probably ninety percent of where they most often drove. And that page didn’t have Adnan’s prints on it.
His palm print was only on the back cover of the book. Plus, thirteen other, unidentified prints turned up on and in the map book. None of them matched Adnan, or Jay. So, the prints weren’t exactly conclusive.
Over the past few weeks, I’ve been holding up bits of evidence here and there that look bad for Adnan. Today, I’m just going to lay out the rest.
Everything else that a person could reasonably add to the ‘Adnan is guilty’ side of the scale.
Some of these I have mentioned before but, let’s just hang them all up, side-by-side, and see what they look like.
First off, there’s a question of whether Adnan asked Hae for a ride that day after school. Was he looking for an excuse to get in her car, so he could kill her.
Adnan told him he’d asked her for a ride
Then, you know how Adnan says he can’t remember much at all about the day Hae went missing? How it was just a normal day to him, nothing much stands out? I’ve wondered about that.
wouldn’t the call from Officer Adcock asking, whether he’s seen Hae just in and of itself, wouldn’t that call make it a not normal day?
call! [Calling to] say, “
Adnan Syed
Oh no, uh, I do remember that phone call and I do remember being high at the time because the craziest thing is to be high and have the police call your phone. I’ll never forget that.
I guess that’s the only thing about the day that seems weird to me that you wouldn’t then, that the day wouldn’t then come into focus for you because you’d gotten this call from the cops and you know, you, you were high, you were young, you know, it’s a - it’s a scary call to get or just a just a jarring call to get.
If the police are at her house, you know, if her mother, actually, you know for, for whatever reason, if she didn’t, you know she didn’t go home or she went somewhere else. In no way did I associate this call with being, you know, umm the beginning of you know, of this whole horrible thing.
to me, all this call was, Hae’s going to get in a lot you trouble
you know, her mother is going to be pissed when she comes home, right.
To be fair to Adnan, if this really was his reaction, then he wasn’t the only one. The seriousness of Hae’s disappearance didn’t start sinking in with her friends for a while.
School was cancelled on January 14th and 15th because of the ice storm, then the weekend came
Then Monday was Martin Luther King Day, so the kids didn’t all reconvene at school until the following Tuesday.
All of Hae’s friends I spoke to said they initially thought Hae had either run off someplace with her new boyfriend Don or, this was another rumor
that she’d run off to California. Friends said she talked about that sometimes, that her dad, or maybe it was her step dad, was in California, and she wanted to go there.
Next, the night before Hae disappeared, Adnan called her house three times. Seems like the only time they actually spoke was the third call, at 12:35am.
neither Hae’s home number nor her pager shows up again, which suggests he never tried to contact her after she went missing
They were supposedly such good friends.
Well, I know that we would always, I-I can’t remember if I did page her or not but, we would always talk about it at school. I would always like get my information first hand from like Aisha who would usually be in contact with obvi-, if I can remember she was like in contact with Hae’s family. So it was kind of like I would always, if not Aisha or Krista or or or it I mean  it wasn’t like I was just sittin’ around, like not even thinking about her. You know, not paging her or whatever, but I used to always get my information from them first hand, you know, it-it’s not it- I don’t remember if I ever paged her or not.
You know, it just seems that, I know Krista was trying to page her, I know Aisha was trying to page her, during this time to just be like ‘where are you, where are you, where are you?’ And I was wondering if you had- were in the group of like ‘where are you?’
(long pause)
What, are you asking me a question?
is that it seems like your relationship you had with her, you would have been one of those people saying, ‘hey, hey, hey like give a holler, where are you okay, we’re all worried about you.’
No! It does not mean I’m not right alongside with them. It’s not like they’re in a hole, I mean, we’re all seeing each other everyday, we’re talking about it. It’s not like you know, it’s not like I’m just sitting there like whenever Hae comes up in a conversation I’m leaving, going to another side of the classroom or something like that. I mean, I’m just as involved as they are, yeah so, I mean, I don’t
you know.
Then, there are some stray things. That, eh, I don’t know what they mean.
Or if they mean much of anything
But I’m going to tell you about them in case
“I’m really getting annoyed that this situation is going the way it is” she wrote, “you know, people break up all the time. Your life is not going to end. You’ll move on and I’ll move on. But apparently you don’t respect me enough to accept my decision.”
Aisha Pittman read this note at trial, Hae was her best friend. Adnan had shown Aisha the letter, apparently in health class. And they had written notes to each other on the back. Aisha in pencil, Adnan in pen.
They were joking, making fun of Hae, making fun of themselves, it’s all just silliness
But then, at the top of the page it says, “I’m going to kill.” In pen.
The note just seems like you guys are just messing around.
So that wasn’t on the note when I was writing with it. So for, to see it later, it was one of those things where it’s like, that’s weird to see that but, I don’t know when that would have been written or what the--
I don’t-- no, because when I am first seeing that part of it, it was sitting in court having to read the rest of the letter.
Police had found the note when they searched Adnan’s house. But, who knows about that one, right? Seems like a detail you’d find in a cheesey detective novel.
“My daughter just heard something about a dead body.” Dave told the cops, “It was the neighbor boy who mentioned it.” Dave names the neighbor boy but, I’m just going to call him The Neighbor Boy. Here’s Dave…
He was, he was, with a friend and the friend said something like, ‘look what I have’ and he popped the trunk and that’s what he saw.
Did he seem upset or..?
     Laura
     He seemed disturbed. More like a ‘wow, I can’t believe what I just saw.’ Kinda almost like he was maybe getting something off his chest, that type of thing.
I asked Laura, did The Neighbor Boy tell you the name of this friend that showed him the body?
I think the guy’s name was maybe Adnan?
Really?
Hm. So this guy said, ‘my friend Adnan showed me the body of a girl in the back of a car?’
Umm-hmm. Yes.
Do you think he was telling the truth?
Yes
Laura didn’t go to Woodlawn. She didn’t know Adnan, she’d known The Neighbor Boy since they were little, they were friendly
she never spoke to police about this, they never questioned her.
So this sounds really really bad, right? That there was another witness, besides Jay, who saw Hae’s body, who saw Adnan with Hae’s body. That’s huge.
he is now somebody else’s neighbor and he’s a man
He was affable and patient and he wholly denied this episode. He was pretty convincing. He said quote, “the only dead body I’ve seen was on TV. God’s honest truth. Except for my great-grandmother. She died when I was like nine.” The Neighbor Man said that he wasn’t friends with Adnan.
I wouldn’t kid around about something like that.”
This is what’s weird.
That original police report about Dave and his daughter Laura, it’s dated April 28th. By that time, Adnan had already been in jail for nearly two months. But Laura was under the impression that what happened to her neighbor had just happened. She told her dad right away, and he called the cops right away. And, I talked to friends of Jay’s who also knew The Neighbor Boy, and they said, “oh that guy?” They gave the impression The Neighbor Boy was a bit of a gossip. A guy untalented at keeping secrets
Which, could play either way I guess. But they meant it like, “nobody would tell him anything they wanted to stay quiet.”
And if Laura’s story is true, then there’s another witness to this murder
It’s one of the things about this case that kind of bobs above the water for me, like a disturbing buoy.
Cathy
So, after Hae had been killed, but before they went to bury her body. It was about six o’clock at night.
She knew Jay a little bit, but only through Jenn. She didn’t know Adnan at all. So, here was an acquaintance, Jay, and a stranger, who suddenly show up at her door.
and I was kinda surprised and a little confused because he didn’t call me unless he was with Jenn and nobody had called to say “hey are you guys home? Do you guys want to hang out?” Nothing like that. So it was a little strange that he would just pop up at the door. I remember him being like, “do you want to smoke? Do you wanna hang out?” And I remember being like, “well hang on a second,” and asking Jeff if he wanted to-- “Jay’s at the door!” Jeff was like, “for what?” “Well he wants to hang out.” And Jeff was like, “that’s cool.” So Jay came in and he introduced his friend, I don’t think he introduced him by name, I think he was just like, “this is a friend of mine.”
Cathy remembers Jay sat over by the table and Adnan settled on the floor on some big cushions that were there, and didn’t speak.
Cathy
doing
amidst all my cushions
who is this guy
This is a girl who says some kid she didn’t know who was high was acting strangely in her living room.
I’ve been that girl for Christ sakes.
Having to deal with some stoned friend of a friend on the living room floor. And I’ve probably been that wierd guy on the floor at least once. But, listening to Cathy tell it, all these years later, the way it stuck with her, how she describes the whole night as just feeling wrong, that also made it stick with me.
Cathy thought Jay was acting odd as well
She knew him as this super laid back stoner guy, like Shaggy from Scooby-Doo.
But now he was being conspicuously chatty.
“How was your day?” “What’s going on?” Kinda-- dominated the conversation really.
Jay and Adnan were there, Jenn called the apartment
The story Cathy is telling is pretty close to what she told the cops during the investigation
“how do I get rid of a high?”
Cathy
--and he asked “how do I get rid of a high? I have to meet someone or do something and it’s really important.” And I was like, “you just have to let it-- just have to let it go.”
No, he didn’t-- I’m not clear whether I remembered him saying “I have to go talk to someone” or “I have to go meet someone” or “I have to go do something.” I’m not sure he-- I remember him expressing it was really important what he had to go do. He didn’t specify what.
There are three incoming calls on the call log that ping towers near Cathy’s house.
6:07, 6:09, and 6:24 p.m
And Hae’s brother, Young,
one phone call
She says, they’re sitting around talking, when one of Cathy’s favorite shows is on the TV, Judge Judy.
“what am I going to do? What am I gonna say? They’re gonna come talk to me. What am I supposed to say?”
And I remember him sounding very worried-- concerned. This was-- whatever was happening was not good on the other line. I remember being like, “wow, I wonder what he’s going--” eavesdropping basically! Wondering what was going on. Not too long after he hung up the phone, he left. Just bust out the door, left.
Jay follows Adnan out, leaves his hat and smokes behind,
Cathy
     And so now they’re outside in a car and I remember going to the window, “what are they doing? Jeff, they’re in the car, they’re just sitting there. What the hell is going on?” Just finding the whole situation super odd, super strange. And Jeff, he just didn’t give a shit about anything. “Eh, it doesn’t matter, who cares? You know?” I just remember being like, “what is going on?”
Was it--you’d never met the other guy before, Adnan, right? So you didn’t know what was normal behavior for him?
clearly it was not normal behavior for anybody
Clearly you could tell something was going on, something was going on [that] wasn’t good, and yeah, it was just strange behavior for anybody.
think that’s been the one thing I’ve always remembered. Like how he said it, how he looked, when he said it
He’s definitely panicked. He’s definitely worried
and
I could imagine if I was in a position that’s what I would’ve been saying on the phone to my best friend. You know, “my god, what am I gonna do? They’re gonna come talk to me. What am I supposed to say?” You know, trying to come up with some story quickly.
“oh, it’s nothing.”
I didn’t get a full account.
The next time I talked to Adnan, I told him how Cathy still remembered all this stuff, how shady the whole scene was for her. And he said that on a bunch of levels, what Cathy had to say didn’t hold much water with him. First of all, if someone had called him to warn him the police were about to call, why would he then answer the phone when the police called?
I mean, if I was expecting the police to call me I probably wouldn’t have answered my phone then.
(long pause)
But then it still leaves us with the third person. This third individual--
So now who was this third person on the phone? So, at some point, her memory either benefits me or it doesn’t benefit me.
Her testimony does not look good for you, you know. Because she’s not really connected to Jay, she’s not connected to you, you know she’s a little bit more objective I would say, and she really thought you were acting, very strangely. You know. So it didn’t-- it’s not good for you, what she has to say. (clears throat)
Adnan Syed
don’t
Like I seriously doubt she would have gave this a second thought had I never been charged with Hae’s murder.
he didn’t identify himself
she assumed it was Adnan
Westview Mall, she says she saw them arrive in Adnan’s car.
n the Adnan side, that detail has always stuck with me too. That Jenn says Adnan seemed so normal
The thing about Jenn and Cathy though, is that even though they don’t look great for Adnan, they don’t actually contradict Adnan’s own account of that evening.
Which, I think, is why he kind of shrugs them off. And why I’m sometimes tempted to shrug them off.
Because Adnan has always admitted he was hanging out with Jay that night.
So, so what if a couple of people saw them together? What does that prove?
But, now we come to the big one
It’s the Nisha call.
Think of it as a title, capitalized, The Nisha Call
Nisha
Adnan
Silver Spring
I don’t. And… uh I have no idea why he would call and their
Nisha
For a smoking gun, she is very cute, she looks like a chipmunk.
Thank you.
Ummm, it’s a little hard to recall, but I remember him telling me that Jay invite- invited him over to a video store that he worked at. And, he basically well Adnan walked in with his cell phone and then like- he told me to speak with Jay and I was like ‘okay’ cause Jay wanted to say hi so I said hi to Jay. And that’s all I can really recall.
Kevin Urick
Now if I had to guess, I’d say that the prosecutor is trying to get her to not mention the video store, because it contradicts their story.
hen she goes on. She doesn’t mention the video store to Urick again
But still, if Adnan is supposedly at school  during this time, and Jay is not talking to Nisha for two minutes and twenty-two seconds, then who the hell is calling Nisha?
This is what Adnan can’t explain.
You can see he calls her a lot on his cell.
very first number he dials
But if she-- she says she testifies that her phone does not have an answering machine or voicemail on it. So who is picking up that call and talking for two and a half minutes or whatever it was? Two minutes and twenty-two seconds or some--
--cause I’m almost sure I remember-- I’m sure I remember her phone having an answering machine or voicemail, or something--
I for sure a thousand percent say I was not in the car with him at that time or did I have access to the phone at that time, because I was at school that day.
I’ve swiveled the Rubik’s Cube of this case so many different ways. I’ve arranged and rearranged it to come up with alternate versions of how this day might have actually gone
And I can get pretty far in certain hypothetical directions.
Jay’s got the car, Jay’s got the phone, all these calls are to his friends
And then I remember the Nisha call, and the whole thing crumbles.
The Nisha call is a big, fat problem for Adnan
Adnan says his biggest fear is not being believed. When he’s sure about something, he has a tendency to over explain, to inundate you with facts and information, and then corroboration for the facts and information.
Adnan Syed
     Anyone who knows me will say I kinda go overboard to the point where people will be like, “alright man, we believe you.” It could be about anything, it could be about whether it rained yesterday, because in my mind it’s something-- it’s a personality quirk born of all this. I mean I really-- I don’t like to talk about things if I can prove-- no matter how silly it is.
Sarah Koenig
He does it with anything. He’s a cook at the prison, and he said he got into a discussion with some guys recently about barbecue sauce. Adnan was saying if you don’t have molasses or brown sugar you can substitute pancake syrup, and the guys were like, “nah, no way.” And so at breakfast, Adnan made a little batch of barbecue sauce using pancake syrup.
Nobody needs barbecue sauce at breakfast time, at the maximum security prison in Cumberland, Maryland. But he did it anyway.
All these things that look bad for Adnan, everything that’s raised my suspicion, even stupid things, I’ve run every single one of them by him. I’ve got this thing in my head that I’ll catch him in a lie. Maybe just a tiny, meaningless lie, and that’s going to be his tell, and he’ll be caught.
and then I don’t believe him?
That notion, that people out there in the world, people he went to school with, who knew him, don’t believe him, that they can imagine he is capable of killing Hae, Adnan spent fifteen years thinking about that. And then trying not to think about that.
or if there was like-- Hae fought back and there was all this stuff of me, like DNA, like scratches,
That used to really devastate me, kind of. You know what I’m saying? That used to just really, really just strike me to my core. And uh--
     Sarah Koenig
     Just like, “what is it about me that would allow someone to even entertain the possibility that I could do this?” Is that the thing?
They saying that I plotted and planned and kept my true intentions hidden, I mean just some real devious, cruel, like Hitler type stuff. You know what I mean? Just some real some like cruel, cruel like inhuman type stuff. Like, “wow man!” you know what I mean? I obviously-- I’m not saying that I was a great person or anything, but I don’t think I ever displayed any tendencies like that--
-where a person would think that you know-- I mean maybe, who knows, maybe if it would have happened to someone else, I would have believed it just because I naturally would have assumed that, well if the police got the right guy, they got him for the right reasons.
What the hell does that even mean?
No! They don’t! No they-- not everyone has the ability to do something cruel and heinous like this
him
I thought I didn’t care about this too much, but obviously I probably do.
Well, because, you know, it-you know, it kinda doesn’t really matter what people think, you know what I’m saying? It doesn’t uh- I shouldn’t care.
But then, I see many problems with Adnan’s story too. And so I start to doubt him, I talk to him and talk to him, and I start to doubt my doubts
And then I worry that I’m a sucker that I don’t know.
That’s the cycle
But I also told him really what really hooked me most, was him. Just trying to figure out, who is this person who says he didn’t kill this girl but is serving a life sentence for killing this girl.
My interest in it honestly has been you, like you’re a really nice guy. Like I like talking to you, you know, so then it’s kind of like this question of well, what does that mean? You know.
I mean, you don’t even really know me though uh Koenig.
I’m, you don’t. I- I- maybe you do. Maybe, I don’t- we only talk on the phone, I don’t understand
But wait, are you saying you don’t think that I know you at all?!
I mean for you to say that I’m a great person. I mean, like a nice person, then you know what I’m saying? That- I- I-don’t know I’ve only talked to you on the phone a few times. I don’t,  I mean I guess you investigated me back then.
And so, I was a little bit like taken aback, and I still like I guess feel a little taken aback that like… what do you think I don’t know? About you.
To be honest with you, it kinda- I feel like I want to shoot myself, if I hear someone else say, I don’t think he did it cause you’re a nice guy, Adnan.
I would rather someone say, Adnan, I think you’re a jerk, you’re selfish, you know, you’re a crazy SOB, you should just stay in there for the rest of your life except that I looked at your case and it looks, you know, like a little off.
I understand this, being a nice guy doesn’t count as exculpatory evidence. And if I’m going to spend a year figuring out that he’s a nice guy, I might as well piss off. Point taken.
Maybe, we need some experts on this job.

Somebody once asked, ""Could I spare some change for gas?
I need to get myself away from this place""
I said, ""Yep, what a concept
I could use a little fuel myself and we could all use a little change""
Well, the years start comin' and they don't stop comin'
Fed to the rules and I hit the ground runnin'
Didn't make sense not to live for fun
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb
So much to do, so much to see
So what's wrong with taking the backstreets?
You'll never know if you don't go (Go)
You'll never shine if you don't glow
Hey now, you're an all star
Get your game on, go play
Hey now, you're a rock star
Get the show on, get paid
(And all that glitters is gold)
Only shootin' stars break the mold
(And all that glitters is gold)
Only shootin' stars break the mold"

You just hurt my goddamn feeling and that was the last one I had
Does this look like an arcade? Tryna play games?
Or get sauteed and rotisseried while you're hog-tied
MCs get so quiet you can hear a motherfuckin' dog whistle when I walk by
Colt Seavers on a mule, stuntin' on that ass like the fuckin' Fall Guy
I don't gas my Mercedes after midnight, I treat it like a Mogwai
'Cause it will turn into a Gremlin
and run over kids, women, and men
Bitch, give me them digits, why you cringin'?
Do you think it's gonna cost me a pretty penny? Shit, if I think a penny's pretty
Just imagine how beautiful a quarter is to me;
Eenie-meenie-miney-mo
Catch an Eskimo by his toe while he's tryna roll a snowball
But don't make him lose his cool, if he hollers, better let him go, y'all
You don't own me
Now here we go, go, go
Get up, baby, get a move on like a U-Haul,
you can rack your brain
Like pool balls;
Well, here I come, Havoc on the beat, I wreak it;
Evil, I see
Hear, and speak it,
Put your eggs in the same basket, you can count every motherfuckin'
Chicken 'fore it hatches
'cause you can bet your ass that we gonna get it crackin'
Like the Kraken and Titans when they're clashin',
get your brains bashed in
So bad, you will have Kurt Cobain askin' to autograph a bloodstained napkin
Unfashionable,
and 'bout as rational as a rash on a fag's asshole
Now let's take that line, run it up the flagpole
With Elton, see if he's cool with it,
Y'all are so motherfuckin' full of shit that you're stocked up
Me, I'm always shittin' diarrhea of the mouth 'til your speakers crap out (*
fart
*) Huh, what?
Girl, you got a hot butt like a lit cigarette (Chig-chigga-ret-ret)
But you won't get a hot fudge sundae from me
You don't own me
Now here we go, go, go
And now that I got your panties in a bunch and your bowels in an uproar
I'ma show you why I came, so you stop askin' me, ""What the fuck for?""
Now look you little slut, cunt, whore, I know you want more
Bitch, it's time to put the math back into Mathers 'cause I'm a fuckin' problem—run, boy!
Comes straight from the fish's ass, yeah, in other words, I'm a bass-turd
Lookin' at me like I killed Kenny, gas in the tank—yeah, still plenty
No morals are instilled in me,
Eat your heart out, Hannibal, understandable why you're jealous
Fuck an animal, I got cannibal magnetism, can't resist him now—can you, hoe?
Bitch, I flow
Like Troy Polamalu's hair, boy, don't you dare try to follow or compare, boy
I'm raw, you ain't even medium-rare,
All this weak shit, what am I, steroids?
Well, bitch, I'm back with some shit for that ass and your trunk, elephant hemorrhoids
You don't own me
Now here we go, go, go
Thank you for coming out
I hope you enjoyed the show
'Til next time (Ha-ha)
Peace (Peace, peace)"

Something else is controlling me
Under her pictures live some of the greatest quotes from me
Under me, I see all the people that claim they over me
I'd have to be dead for them to say that you took it from me
CJ grab racks out the bag and throw it to me
Trust in my brothers is as strong as I know it should be
Future sign the contracts, he don't even show it to me
I need you, I need you, I need you
I need to make you see
What you mean to me
Until I do, I'm hoping you will know what I mean
The city's on fire and people are in denial
Charges being laid, but we'll see what they do at trial
I'm calling this shit from now
Sweetheart deals that the judges been handing down
I used to hide my pain in Delilah behind the bar 'til my niggas carried me out
And if money's all I need in my grave, then bury me now
I know I tend to talk about how I got a fortune on me
But with that comes the politics the city been forcing on me
Man, I can't even R.I.P. and show my remorse to the homie
Know I carry the guilt of the city's misfortunes on me
Career is going great, but now the rest of me's fading slowly
Seen too many brothers get twenty-five from the boys
I'd rather see all of 'em get twenty-five from the Lord
And if the last negotiation made you pay me twenty-five
Well, this is the perfect time to give me twenty-five more
Co-parent of the year, we figured out a rapport
No fair what Drizzy made on the second leg of the tour
How the **** do we manage to win everything but awards?
And if the last negotiation had you feeling out of pocket
Well, this is the perfect time that I empty them shits for sure
You owe that shit to the boy, yeah

Maybe Jamaica rum
Maybe some Jonnie Dub

Sound so smart like you graduated college
Like you went to Yale, but you probably went to Howard, knowing you
Might've been a time where I loved her too
But you take that away and you've always been the one, one
I wonder why the moon looks nice, girl
Maybe it's just right for the night
You said niggas coming on too strong, girl
They want you in they life as a wife
That's why you wanna have no sex, why you wanna protest
Why you wanna fight for your right
'Cause you don't love them boys
Pussy run everything, fuck that noise
And my shit's so wet, you gotta paddle in
Done did the pop tour, I'm the realest still
The best legal team, so the deals is ill
It's MAC, OPI, and a fragrance too

Everything the light touches
In my freshest J's
Cause this the summer that our life change

I looked around at all his nice things
Told him, ""Nigga, you already know it""
Bitch, I'm the man of the year
Straight through this bitch
What you 'sposed to do when the OG niggas don't get it?
Lost what was once theirs but they won't quit it
Homie, it's a new era, middle finger to the suit-wearers
Lemme show you how to move in a room
Full of dudes that don't got a fuckin' clue how to do this
Prolly worked with Cube, so to them, this a Rubik
My President is black, but my jeweler's still Jewish
So you know it cost, he makin' a killing off me
Red diamonds he designing got me shining
my chain blinding
Me and Hovi Hov, out on the same island
Took the whip to the other side of Jamaica
Seen how he was living, said ""I gotta get my weight up""

But me, I want Jordan numbers, LeBron footin'
Can't guard me, Vince Lombardi, John Wooden

So like him, you'll be gone too early

And Cole keep a thick bitch I like to call Big Shirley

18 and under, that's prolly gonna take a minute
At the time of this rhyme, 5 years 'til I know 30
This next shit is in no way to boast
But my city love breakfast, 'cause niggas had toast early
Coach had us doin' jumpin' jacks
Then sent us to the water fountain after runnin' laps
My nigga went and grabbed his bookbag, threw it on his back
And brought it to me just to show me he was fuckin' strapped
We was twelve years old, how was we to know better?
I analyzed his life and see that he was so set up
Means you don't got a nigga comin' 'round to guide a nigga
All you got is mama bringin' home these rotten niggas
Blowin' reefers, all the teachers do is ride a nigga
So this is who I speak fo'
Yeah, I stunt, but I'm a li'l more realer
When it come from the heart, don't it feel mo' iller?
Watch my flow go bananas, I'm a li'l gorilla
They say I rep that 'Ville too much, but that shit just a part of me
It's flowin' out through my arteries,
You JV, I'm varsity
ain't hard to see,
this real shit, you R&B
(Woo!) That boy Simba crazy
Hotter than Ike Turner temper,
you December, maybe
And though you wish me well, I know deep down you wish I'd fail
It's Judgment Day, I'm here to give you pussy niggas hell
Yeah, I heard the hate, but the wait is fuckin' over
It's like I'm fuckin' Oprah, well worth the wait

Don't worry 'bout it you got it (You got it)
Hustle Gang on your chest
We spend our winters in the Summer of Australia
On acres without the neighbors
Once you go great, you never go good
You never go back, even if you could
I'll show you my way, I got that good-good
You never go back, even if you could
Have you ever wished your life would change?
Woke up and you lived your dreams
Have you ever wished your life would change? (Yeah? Yeah)
Woke up and you lived your dreams (Your dreams)
Once you go great, you never go good
You never go back, even if you could
I'll show you my way, I got that good-good
You never go back, even if you could"
DUCKWORTH.,Kendrick Lamar,2017,2109138.0,https://genius.com/Kendrick-Lamar-DUCKWORTH-lyrics,"It was always me versus the world
Until I found it's me versus me
Why, why, why, why?
Why, why, why, why?
Just remember, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
!
We gon' put it in reverse
Darling, I told you many times
And I am telling you once again
Just to remind you, sweetheart
That my—
Oh, Lamar
Hail Mary and marijuana, times is hard
Pray with the hooligans, shadows all in the dark
Fellowship with demons and relatives, I'm a star
Life is one funny ma'fucker
A true comedian, you gotta love him, you gotta trust him
I might be buggin', infomercials and no sleep
Introverted by my thoughts; children, listen, it gets deep
See, once upon a time inside the Nickerson Garden projects
The object was to process and digest poverty's dialect
Adaptation inevitable: gun violence, crack spot
Federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals
Anthony was the oldest of seven
Well-respected, calm and collected
Laughin' and jokin' made life easier; hard times, mama on crack
A four-year-old tellin' his nanny he needed her
His family history: pimpin' and bangin'
He was meant to be dangerous
clocked him a grip and start slangin'
Fifteen, scrapin' up his jeans with quarter pieces
Even got some head from a smoker last weekend
Dodged a policeman, workin' for his big homie
Small-time hustler, graduated to a brick on him
That was back when he turned his back and they killed his cousin
He beat the case and went back to hustlin'
Bird-shufflin', Anthony rang
The first in the projects with the two-tone Mustang, that 5.0 thing
They say 5-0 came
circlin' parking lots and parking spots
And hoppin' out while harrassin' the corner blocks
Crooked cops told Anthony he should kick it
He brushed 'em off and walked back to the Kentucky Fried Chicken
See, at this chicken spot, there was a light-skinned nigga that talked a lot
With a curly top and a gap in his teeth, he worked the window
His name was Ducky
he came from the streets, The Robert Taylor Homes
Southside Projects, Chiraq, the Terror Dome
Drove to California with a woman on him and five-hundred dollars
They had a son, hopin' that he'd see college
Hustlin' on the side with a nine-to-five to freak it
Cadillac Seville, he'd ride his son around on weekends
Three-piece special with his name on the shirt pocket
'Cross the street from the projects, Anthony planned to rob it
Stuck up the place before, back in '84
That's when affiliation was really at gears of war
So many relatives tellin' us, sellin' us devilish works, killin' us, crime
Intelligent, felonious prevalent proposition with 9's
Ducky was well-aware
They robbed the manager and shot a customer last year
He figured he'd get on these niggas' good sides
Free chicken every time Anthony posted in line, two extra biscuits
Anthony liked him and then let him slide, they didn't kill him
In fact, it look like they're the last to survive
pay attention
That one decision changed both of they lives, one curse at a time
Reverse the manifest and good karma, and I'll tell you why
You take two strangers and put 'em in random predicaments
Give 'em a soul, so they can make their own choices and live with it
Twenty years later, them same strangers, you make 'em meet again
Inside recording studios where they reapin' their benefits
Then you start remindin' them about that chicken incident
Whoever thought the greatest rapper would be from coincidence?
Because if Anthony killed Ducky, Top Dawg could be servin' life
While I grew up without a father and die in a gunfight

To escape this old world, this old world
Some days I lie wide awake 'til the sun hits my face
And I fade, elevate from the Earth
I don't trust anything
Or anyone, below the sun
I get lifted, I get lifted
I get lifted, I get lifted
Some only live to die, I'm alive to fly higher
Than angels in outfields inside of my mind
I'm ascendin' these ladders, I'm climbin', say goodbye
This old world, this old world
And when I fall to rise with stardust in my eyes
In the backbone of night, I'm combustible
Dust in the fire when I can't sleep a wink, I'm too tired
I don't trust anything
Or anyone, below the sun
I get lifted, I get lifted
I get lifted, I get lifted
I get lifted, I get lifted"

Diamonds are forever
They are all I need to please me
They can stimulate and tease me
They won't leave in the night
I've no fear that they might desert me
Diamonds are forever
Forever, forever
(Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe)
Diamonds are forever
Forever, forever
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
(
Forever
) Forever ever? Forever ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
(
And ever
) Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Good mornin', this ain't Vietnam, still
People lose hands, legs, arms, for real
Little was known of Sierra Leone
And how it connect to the diamonds we own
My chain, these ain't conflict diamonds
Is they, Jacob? Don't lie to me, mane
See, a part of me sayin' keep shinin'
How when I know what a blood diamond is?
Though it's thousands of miles away
Sierra Leone connect to what we go through today
Over here, it's a drug trade, we die from drugs
Over there, they die from what we buy from drugs
The diamonds, the chains, the bracelets, the charmses
I thought my Jesus piece was so harmless
'Til I seen a picture of a shorty armless
And here's the conflict
It's in a black person soul to rock that gold
Spend your whole life tryna get that ice
On a Polo rugby, it look so nice
How can somethin' so wrong make me feel so right?
Right? 'Fore I beat myself up like Ike
You can still throw your Roc-a-Fella diamond tonight, because
Diamonds are forever
Forever, forever
Diamonds are forever
Forever, forever
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme

Forever
) Forever ever? Forever ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?

And ever
) Ever, ever? Ever, ever?

People askin' me is I'm gon' give my chain back (

That'll be the same day I give the game back (
Uh

You know the next question, dawg, ""Yo, where Dame at?"" (
Uh
)
This track the Indian dance that bring our rain back (
Woo
)
I got it from here, 'Ye, damn
The chain remains, the gang is intact (Uh-huh)
The name is mine, I'll take blame for that
The pressure's on, but guess who ain't gon' crack?
Haha, pardon me, I had to laugh at that
How could you falter when you're the Rock of Gibraltar?
I had to get off the boat so I could walk on water
This ain't no tall order, this is nothin' to me
Difficult takes a day, impossible takes a week
I do this in my sleep, I sold kilos of coke (So?)
I'm guessin' I can sell CDs
I'm not a businessman, I'm a business, man
Let me handle my business, damn
Kanyeez you got me, Freeway then Foxy
YG's, Teairra Mari, Peedi watch me
Bleek could be one hit away his whole career
As long as I'm alive, he's a millionaire
And even if I die, he's in my will somewhere
So he could just kick back and chill somewhere, oh, yeah
He won't even have to write rhymes
The Dynasty like my money: last three lifetimes
Shirley Bassey's in the rear, sayin' exactly
What I been sayin' practically my whole career
The diamond is forever, I've been minin' this forever
Now the Louis Vuitton Don's timin' couldn't be better
People lined up to see the Titanic sinkin'
Instead, we rose up from the ash like a phoenix
If you're waitin' for the end of the Dynasty sign
It would seem like forever is a mighty long time
I'm Young, bitches!
Good night!"

Some of these people do not even have TV, so they can't afford cable
Some of them can afford a radio
So the only thing they can listen to is the music
People the ghetto, people from the projects, street people
Hortical ghetto youth who know what it is to sing about suffering and reality
New York girl, dem a mad over we
New York girl, dem a mad over we
New York girl, dem a mad over we
New York girl, dem a mad over we
Smoking a escubano
Hope I don't catch a hommo
grossing our net
Simultaneously making me climb higher
Heinous crimes behind me
So anyone move next, I'll hit you with two TECs
Rocking Roberto Cavalli, no shirt on, convertible Mazi
My Colombiana mommy riding beside me
Every tat mean something, that's my word on my body
I'll have to lean something with that Mossberg shotty
My niggas is ignant, put lead in your pigment
In '97 the six
'98 the Bentley
Now it's the Ghost Phantom
Army jacket swag, army jacket green and black
With the square top pocket that snaps
where the gas at?
you hold cracks in your ass crack
I never did that, my sock's where my stash was at
Yo, I used to listen to that Red Alert
and Rap Attack
I fell in love with all that poetry I mastered that
Cutting school where Preme team and Fat Cat was at
Future not crystal clear yet, Baccarat
Now I'm the one who repping Queens
Way beyond your wildest dreams
Twenty years in this game, looking seventeen
I don't lean: no codeine, promethazine
I just blow green, pick which bitch to bless the king
Although he's on to another chapter
Heavy D gave this beat to Salaam for me to rap to
New York is like an Island, a big Rikers Island
The cops be out wilding, all I hear is sirens
It's all about surviving, same old two-step
Try to stay alive when they be out robbing
I been out rhyming since born knowledge
Like prophet Muhammad said the ink from a scholar
Worth more than the blood of a martyr
so I'ma
Keep it on 'til I see a billion dollars
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer

Got yo' bitch under the cover suckin' on me like a bae
Just cruisin' by on flat tires in an '06 Chevy
I'm Donnie Darko when I spark up and I'm creepin' like Frank
Pull up in a Lamborghini just so you can see me
Swerve into a telephone pole, my skeleton broke
Pirellis smoke and burn
Bitch, I was next in line for heaven
But then I ingested a double cup full of that fucking insecticide
The sun turned black
The sky replaced by the face with giant reddened eyes"

Jermaines Interlude,DJ Khaled,2016,299520.0,https://genius.com/DJ-Khaled-Jermaines-Interlude-lyrics,"Oh, I had so many days of crying
Oh, I had so many days of pain
Have you ever been as sad as I am?
Lord, I ask if anything would change?
I can see the future that we're heading
I would say it's better not to tell
If it's anything like this in Heaven
Maybe I'd be better off in hell
(Better off in hell)
Tables do turn and labels do burn
The second they ask you to sell your soul
Don't you do it, don't you fold, say ""Fuck that shit"" and be bold
Cause all them stories you told on records worth more than gold
And if you never go gold again, at least you would know
The end of your road was chose, by you and not companies
Who control our remote control, and hide the truth on my no
But don't mind me, I'm just high again
Smokin' weed to get by again
No, actually I'm lyin' 'cause smokin' ain't got me smilin'
And rhyming like I rhyme
way back when I would play the violin
Thought that shit wasn't cool
Momma sorry, I just stopped tryin' it
Paid for your house in hopes there'd be no more reason for cryin'
That shows you how stupid I am 'cause niggas is out here dying
From police that flash the siren and pull up and just start firin'
Niggas murkin' each other in murky water, I try and swim
How the fuck do I look when I brag to you 'bout some diamond?
Oh, I had so many days of crying
Oh, I had so many days of pain
Have you ever been as sad as I am?
Lord, I ask if anything would change?
I can see the future that we're heading

She be doin' things like havin' them boys
Come from her neighborhood to the studio, tryna fight me
She need to get a piece of the American pie and take her bite out
That's my house, I'll disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby and not a pay check
Private school, daycare, shit, medical bills, I pay that
I love your mom and everything
But see, I ain't the only one who laid down
She wanna rib you up to start a custody war, my lawyers stay down
She never got a chance to hear my side of the story, we was divided
She had fish fries and cookouts for my child's birthday, I ain't invited
Despite it I show her the utmost respect when I fall through
All you, do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah

King meets queen, then the puppy love thing
Together dream 'bout that crib with the Goodyear swing
On the oak tree,
I hope we feel like this forever
Forever, forever ever? Forever ever?
Forever never seems that long until you're grown
And notice that the day-by-day ruler can't be too wrong
Ms. Jackson, my intentions were good, I wish I could
Become a magician to abracadabra all the sadder
Thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
Asking what happened to the feeling that her and me had
I pray so much about it, need some knee pads
It happened for a reason, one can't be mad
So know this, know that everything's cool
And yes, I will be present on the first day of school and graduation

Ask you to take me to go

Drape me in Gucci? No

Show me some love, kisses and hugs
No, I never had an issue
Go to the club with your boys, baby, I
Never wanted you to stay too long
Just wanted you to show me off
So won't you say my name, say my name?
If you claim you want me, it ain't no thang
You acting kind of shady
You ain't been calling me baby, oh
Boy, you can go and stop playing games, playing games
I'm just tryna match your words with your actions
I need more than satisfaction
Is you really 'bout that action?
Swear that you doing the most, but we take a picture, can't post it
How that work?

NEVER,Mag.Lo,2016,291414.0,https://genius.com/MagLo-NEVER-lyrics,"Boil water for my French press
Light an L to alleviate the head stress
My emotions roll over like the head rest
On the plane I connected under sunsets
Start a rhyme for the time I got nothing left
I’m not high this evening, what an upset
Which flight will get me lifted where the sun rest?
Time zones, don't know if she up yet
Google drone, Metro phone, what's the subset?
Finding out on your location what is obsessed?
I’m just kidding for the moment, maybe not yet
Steady chasing your reflection, so eternal yet
She was mountainous like Denver
Oh, how you would November
Hug me tighter in the winter
Sweater sessions, touching linen
Fire burning on your shoulder, you remember
That our life is all worth living
Even in times of forgiveness
It hurts to be so cold
Seeing you warm within December
Without your favorite nigga
Bob could probably paint the pictures
Flowers on your windows
Because you're my favorite art
You're my canvas, you're my heart
Never (Never) have I met someone like you, ahh
Showed me two options so I had to take the third door
Had to take some time to analyze what really hurts more
Vacant from the nine to five or being poor and goin’ for it
Walkin' round, hazy vision living in a time lapse
We were never meant for that, I admire mama, spent her life
So my environment’s conducive to aspiring, she's ironclad
When life strikes, she fires back
Resilient despite my dad's absence, oh, I admire that
I got my CDs, my tees and my flyers packed
This is for my young lads and those who love my prior acts
Lump me with the 2010 kids who rap sad and act cathartic
Middle class aggression once expressed through wack guitar riffs
And this ain’t for the niggas who would tweet before act
This is for my people out of reach of relief, can't speak so they rap
For the tongue tied young minds out seekin' a gat
Holdin' on to they sanity while we preachin' our sentiments
Of lovin' humanity while they can't see the evidence
Been through the ringer of self-doubt and depression
It ain't a preference, I hope they hear me, 'cause I'll be here tellin' them that
Never (Never), ahh (Never)
Never (Never) have I met someone like you, ahh
Never (Never), ahh (Never)
Never (Never) have I met someone like you, ahh
Turbulence (Turbulence)
Is more than mere disturbances
Helps you learn to yearn for life
To reassess your worth and shit
Helps you learn to yearn for life
To reassess your worth and shit
Don't forget to be yourself (And you'll be just fine)
I'll be just fine

Turn my back and slam the door
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight
A kingdom of isolation
And it looks like I'm the queen
The wind is howling like the swirling storm inside
Couldn't keep it in, Heaven knows I tried
Don't let them in, don't let them see
Be the good girl you always have to be
Conceal, don't feel, don't let them know
Well, now they know
Let it go, let it go
Can't hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn my back and slam the door
The cold never bothered me anyway
Up here in the cold, thin air
I finally can breathe
I know I left a life behind
You won't find me
The past is all behind me
Buried in the snow"

My Rolex watch it got 50 carats
It could be QC or even maybe it's me
What's on your mind? I'm not Ginuwine
Gotta pay that cost to be a boss

Dripping in St. Louis, I'm a lunatic
I got the boot but no Timberland
I never leave my niggas starvin'
You niggas mistake me for Marvin
I don't know why I came in this club with you, girl (With you)
Is it 'cause a nigga cook like a professor? (Professor)

I have found in this place
That is circling all 'round the sun
What a beautiful dream
That could flash on the screen
In a blink of an eye and be gone from me
Soft and sweet
Let me hold it close and keep it here with me
And one day we will die
And our ashes will fly
From the aeroplane over the sea
But for now we are young
Let us lay in the sun
And count every beautiful thing we can see
Love to be
In the arms of all I'm keeping here with me
What a curious life
We have found here tonight
There is music that sounds from the street
There are lights in the clouds
Anna's ghost all around
Hear her voice as it's rolling and ringing through me
Soft and sweet
How the notes all bend and reach above the trees
Now how I remember you
How I would push my fingers through
Your mouth to make those muscles move
All secrets sleep in winter clothes
With the one you loved so long ago
Now he don't even know his name
What a beautiful face
I have found in this place
And when we meet on a cloud
I'll be laughing out loud
I'll be laughing with everyone I see
Can't believe
How strange it is to be anything at all"

She hid around corners and she hid under beds
She killed it with kisses and from it she fled
With every bubble, she sank with a drink
And washed it away down the kitchen sink
The dog days are over
The dog days are done
The horses are coming
So you better run
Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father
Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers
Leave all your love and your longing behind
You can't carry it with you if you want to survive
Can you hear the horses?
And I never wanted anything from you
Except everything you had
And what was left after that too, oh
Happiness hit her like a bullet in the back
Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father
Run for your children, for your sisters and brothers
Leave all your love and your longing behind

If you hand me your shit, I'll toss your demo tape
“Hop, if you're not spreading love
Then why do you even write music?""
'Cause this is how I feel
When I ain’t rappin' on the mic, you bitch!

That's Leakin Park.
Saad Chaudry
ex-friend
Automated voice
This is a Global-Tel link prepaid call from Adnan Syed an inmate at a Maryland Correctional facility…
From This American Life and WBEZ Chicago, it's Serial. One story told week by week. I'm Sarah Koenig. Remember how last time I ended by saying that the detectives had other leads in this case besides Mr. S, the guy who found Hae's body, that they were also starting to look at Adnan? Well, the reason we know that is because of this memo:
The memo is dated 12 February 1999. It's from Detective Darryl Massey to Detective Greg MacGillivary.
,
Asian Male 18 to 21 years old,” though its unclear whether Asian in this case means East Asian like Korean or South Asian like Pakistani.
But anyway, a mystery caller says look at the ex-boyfriend.
the caller further stated that the victim broke off the relationship with her boyfriend about a week before she was reported missing.
“oh yeah, by the way...”
friend of his (Vasser 	Ali – Asian Male – 17) “if he ever hurt his girlfriend, he would drive her car into a lake.”
This time the caller mentions a friend of Adnan's, Vasser Ali.
Actually, the name of this friend is
Yasser
The caller says Yasser might know something. Hangs up again. The cops can't trace the call. It's out of range.
The cops didn't figure it out. Adnan's attorney didn't figure it out. I've tried to figure it out too.
Because it seemed to me whoever made this call, he must be the key to the whole thing.
But so far, I only have guesses that I can't responsibly say out loud.
They get a subpoena for Adnan's cell phone records. The results of that subpoena include a list of all the calls dialed and received on Adnan's phone on January 13, the day Hae disappeared.
That list will become arguably the most important piece of paper among all the thousands in this case. It'll become their map. And they'll follow it call by call by call, like footprints that end up at Adnan's front door.
log
Obviously, the first thing they had to do was figure out who all the phone numbers belong to. Home, cell, and pager numbers. Once they do, they realize, “wait a minute. One person was called six times that
That person is an eighteen year old girl named Jennifer Pusateri. Jenn is not a friend of Adnan's. She's a friend of Jay's. Remember, Jay had Adnan's car that day and his new cell phone.
Jennifer Pusateri
And I was like alright. He's like, but I gotta tell you. I gotta tell somebody. I can't, you know. And I was like alright – what's up dude? He's like, um, Adnan killed Hae
And that's when I was just like – woah – what do you mean Adnan killed Hae? Why? What? How? When? Where? You know?
If you want to figure out this case with me, now is the time to start paying close attention because we have arrived, along with the detectives, at the heart of the thing.
This
February 27, 1999.
Then Jenn and a friend go see Jay.
She tells Jay, “the police want to talk to me. What do I do?”
At trial, Jenn says, “he told me to go down there and tell them what I knew. Tell them enough to keep me out of trouble and tell them to go see Jay. Send them his way.”
she lies to them.
She says she doesn't know anything. I've seen the detectives notes from that interview and they're remarkably uninteresting. But by the time she left that night, Jenn thought it was possible she was about to get charged.
“everyone's a suspect and no one's a suspect.”
They turn on a tape recorder –
who, what, where, when, why
he said that Adnan said that Hae broke his heart.
So, Jenn gives them a motive. Hae broke Adnan's heart
He told me, um, he told me, this is what he told me, he told me, he asked, Jay asked me what we should do?
“Adnan showed me her body and asked me if I would help her bury him
Did you help him?
Do you know where the body is?” “No. I just took him to some place in the city and I dropped him off.
Yo
u know, when, you know, when was this done?” He didn't know when.
Yeah, he said that he strangled her in a Best Buy parking lot. But I don't know how he got to a Best Buy parking lot or anything like that.
Jay has told her I saw the body in the trunk of a car.
I didn't – I refused
house – and he tells her that all this went down at the Best Buy parking lot, off Security Boulevard about a mile from Woodlawn Highschool.
Jay and Jenn were close friends at this time, winter of ‘99 – talking or hanging out almost everyday. They'd known each other since elementary school and they were in the same class at Woodlawn.
She's in a sorority.
Jay left her house sometime between 3:45 and 4:15
Adnan says hi to her. She says he seems to be acting normal.
The shovels Adnan had used to dig in the park to bury Hae – that they were Jay's shovels from his house.
Jennifer Pusateri
Jay can retrieve the shovels and wipe the handles clean in case of fingerprints
After that, Jay came back, got in my car, and he was really shooken up. He was completely shooken up. He was like you have to take me to go see my girlfriend now.
The next day Jenn says she drove Jay to the F&M store, that same one where he worked, so that he could throw out the clothes and boots he was wearing the previous night. He pitched them into a dumpster behind the store. One of the cops points out that, for a guy who's telling you he didn't kill anyone and didn't help dispose of a body, he sure is taking a lot of precautions
Jay wasn't along when the body was buried?
– But he's thrown away all of his clothes and he's wiping finger prints off the shovels, things of that nature--
Yeah. Well. It wasn't until today that I thought, I mean, I just don't think that Jay...
I don't think that Jay would lie to me, first of all, and, like, I don't know – unless Adnan paid Jay a good sum of money, I really don't see Jay helping him.
“Oh no. More like casual acquaintances.”
So they get Jay in the interview room and, initially, he pulls a Jenn. He tells them nothing, more or less. He says he walked to the mall that day, got his girlfriend a new bracelet for her birthday, hung around with Jenn's younger brother, talked to Adnan sometime in the afternoon, and then, after two pages of notes like that, it says, “Alright, I come clean.”
At least, that's what I think it says. The detective's handwriting is messy so maybe it says, “A bright eye came down.”
In any case, around twenty minutes later they start taping and Jay tells them a whole different story, one that more or less matches Jenn's – except for one major difference. One major piece of information about this crime that the cops are still missing. They do not know where Hae's car is. They've been looking all over the place for it. They can't find it. Now, Jay tells them he knows where it is.
that
Jay will take them to the car. And he does.
They said some-something like “we know what you and Jay did” or “we talked to Jay”-- and I'm like “Jay? Jay--” like I had a look of puzzlement on my face – like, like “what? What do you mean? Like what do you mean Jay?”
And then the same guy, MacGillivary, he kinda like snorted – like – hmph, you know what we're talking about. No I mean, I had, I had no idea and the reaction that he gave me was like stop playing dumb.
It's not like there was some secret feud between Jay and Adnan, at least not that I know of. There was no drug deal gone wrong. Neither had bad mouthed the other or stolen the other's girlfriend. To hear Adnan tell it, it sounds like they didn't even know each other very well.
However, Adnan was close with Stephanie, Jay's girlfriend – very close.
Stephanie was smart, she was top athlete at the school, she was beautiful by any standard. She looked like a model.
She came from a family of achievers who did not approve of Jay but had no problem with Adnan. So maybe Stephanie's relationship with Adnan – how affectionate they were with each other, the constant talking on the phone, the prom prince and princess stuff – maybe that was gnawing at Jay.
Like, you know, when I was talking about how close I was with Stephanie, and they were like, you know, and you never – like, she looked at me like I was an idiot – like you never thought that this bothered Jay?
Adnan says he didn't feel betrayed by Jay exactly because, again, they weren't good enough friends for betrayal.
maybe somehow he got caught up – for a minute I thought he tried to claim the reward money and he got caught up in the situation.
A year after Adnan was arrested and the case came to trial, Jay walked up to the witness stand. There's a moment when Adnan muttered something to him. He says he couldn't help himself. The judge called the attorneys up to the bench. Quote - I was just informed by my Sheriff that the Defendant made a comment to the witness as the witness approached the stand indicating that he was pathetic, the judge said. I want to advise Mr. Syed that up until now he has been perfect -- don't spoil it.
I'm the criminal element of Woodlawn.
Perceived. It's like how the student body sees me. You know, I mean, people who really know me know that I'm not like that but, you know, you get a certain reputation and kinda sticks with you.
Because of the contacts you have with helping him get his marijuana, he thinks that you're in that element that would be willing to assist him in, um, disposing of the body?
     Jay
     I would guess so. That I would know someone or know where or something.
Do you really believe that the defendant, meaning Adnan, could go to one of his upstanding Magnet School Honor Student friends or a friend from the mosque to assist him with this act? Of course not. He needed someone who behaved a little more dangerously than those people. He needed someone who took risks. The defendant hopes that you will look at Jay and say I don't believe him.
That is why the defendant chose Jay.
They ask him “if you're actually not the type of guy who knows where to bury a body then why did you help? Why didn't you go to the police instead?”
He gives you his car keys. He gives you his cell phone. He tells you a time that he's going to call you. That he's going to kill her.
you do absolutely nothing
You were selling marijuana.
So if I go to the cops and say, “Hey, this guy is a killer.” He'll say, “well no I'm not, he's crazy but there's this drug dealer and here's where he gets his shit from and this is who he deals with and he's got a rap sheet this long and go get his ass.”
But you've never been arrested but one time. You don't really have a rap sheet.
Jay
On the record it's one time. But I've got my ass kicked plenty of times. I've got one arrest. Plenty of times. Dogs sicced on me – chased down out by my own house – fucking gun point, helicopters and shit with my keys in my hands, you know what I mean. It's not, it's not just, you know, I mean seriously man, I been coming home – people whipped out guns made me lay in the street in the snow walking to my own house – just so they can say I was a wrong dude, you know what I mean?
So you didn't trust any police?
     Jay
     I didn't. No. I don't
That never crosses my mind. I could be getting shot at and I wouldn't be “let's call the cops.”
Um, I was just scared and I didn't really think, like-like how it is.
Who are you afraid of if you make an anonymous phone call and you give a description of her car? You give them the tag number of her car...
Can we stop for a second?
     Detective
     Yes.
     Jay
     Can you stop that?
Detective
     If you have any questions, you can ask me on tape.
First it was just, like, shock and then after that, I was part of it. I mean I couldn't just...
Like I said, he knows I sold drugs, I mean...that was, I mean, that's...he could get me locked up for that, I mean. I'm sure if I ratted him out for killing Hae, then he wouldn't hesitate to turn me over for selling drugs.
Um, I feel bad that, you know, I mean, I didn't come forward or do anything but, I just, I feel bad, I mean I feel like I could have stopped it somehow if I, you know, maybe if I'd paid more attention, you know, talked about it.
I just feel bad about it
That's all. That's all I got to say.
The cops have a struggle with Jay. I have a struggle with Jay. He's the biggest mystery of this whole case for me.
Some of these discrepancies seem small to me and understandable but some are significant and confounding. That distance between where a certain detail starts and where it ends up – how far it slides and why it slides. I've spent untold hours trying to measure that distance – trying to weigh it for clues as to what might actually be true.
Westview mall
we did a little
That's a different mall, Security Square Mall – a couple miles away.
70 Park and Ride
At the first trial, Jay says they both got high in Adnan's car, but the second trial, he says only he smoked and Adnan didn't want to.
In the first taped interview, Jay says they're grabbing some food at a restaurant when Officer Adcock calls Adnon asking if he's seen Hae. The next time he tells it, he says that when that call comes, they're at a friend's apartment – a friend whose father happens to be a homicide detective in another county.
want to get her in trouble.
In the first taped statement, Jay says he refused to help dig a grave for Hae. Two weeks later, he says they both dug the hole.
But then, there are other changes – bigger changes – where its harder to judge why the details shift.
This one, for instance: In the first taped interview, Jay says Adnan only told him that same day that he was going to kill Hae. Two weeks later, Jay says that Adnan had started talking about it before hand – four or five days before.
I think I'm gonna kill her.
There's so many more of these. There's a whole side trip Adnan and Jay supposedly take that afternoon, after Hae's been killed to smoke some weed at Patapsco State Park. That trip disappears by trial – just drops out of the narrative – and Jay's whereabouts in between the time he drops Adnan back at school at midday and when he meets back up with him later that afternoon – the stories about where he is are so messy and so confusing that I can't even keep the different versions straight.
I went to pick him up from off of Edmondson Avenue at a strip and he, uh, popped the trunk open and
A strip is a small outdoor drug market
Yes.
Yes.
And the conversation was what?
Um, that bitch is dead. Come and get me. I'm at Best Buy.
Best Buy. Just like Jenn had originally told them. This is a problem for the cops – this change. Because it’s not something you forget – where you were when you saw a dead body in the trunk of a car. It's not a slip of the tongue and its not clear what the calculation is. Edmondson Avenue versus the Best Buy parking lot. What's the advantage of one place over the other? Why tell this lie?
Maybe he's just saying it because it matches Jenn's story – or did he lie to Jenn in the first place and then forget?
I h
cops are the most skeptical people in the world.
They pretty much assume everyone is lying to them all the time. Ritz and MacGillivary aren't newbies. MacGillivary came from a law enforcement family; his father had been captain of the homicide unit, in fact. And Ritz was known in the department, and in the state's attorney's office, as a skilled and meticulous investigator. So, they're not suckers. They're taking careful note of the changes in Jay's stories. It's why they keep going back to him – to clear up the inconsistencies.
In the second taped interview, MacGillivary confronts Jay – ticking off a list of the main things he's lied to him about and Jay admits to all the lies. But, even so, what struck me is that they don't really press him on any of it. The most forceful MacGillivary gets is this exchange about the location of the trunk pop.
Yes.
Sarah Koenig
When he told the Edmondson Avenue version, he was already deeply associated with it.
But MacGillivary lets it go – moves on to another point.
Jay
     To the best that I can possibly, humanly at this point and time remember. That is the truth.
Detective MacGillivary
Jay's story kept changing. You were catching the inconsistencies and he was having to explain them and clean up his story.
Ritz said they believed Jay's story because “we were able to investigate and corroborate what he was saying.”
So how exactly did they corroborate it

Keep me warm in your love, then you softly leave
And it's me you need to show
'Cause we're livin' in a world of fools
Breakin' us down
When they all should let us be
We belong to you and me
I believe in you
You know the door to my very soul
You're the light in my deepest, darkest hour
You're my saviour when I fall
And you may not think I care for you
When you know down inside that I really do
And it's me you need to show
How deep is your love?

Since Ben Baller sold all his ice up at Slauson (Ooh)

I'm bikin' downhill and it sound like a fishin' rod
Ashes and remnants of ballers
Body that's gutted
A Bentley that used to be flawless
In class with the honors
No cheat like I'm honest
And how did I become so accomplished?
'Cause I don't see foes (Foes)
I just see a code (Code)
I just see a hole
Chinks in your armor
Like Pac in the Hummer
Like Jigga in summer
Left the house like Obama
Hit the road like a runner

How the Grinch Stole Christmas,Dr. Seuss,1957,310584.0,https://genius.com/Dr-Seuss-How-the-Grinch-Stole-Christmas-lyrics,"Every Who down in Whoville liked Christmas a lot.
The Grinch hated Christmas! The whole Christmas season!
Now, please don't ask why. No one quite knows the reason.
It could be, perhaps, that his shoes were too tight.
It could be his head wasn't screwed on just right.
But I think that the most likely reason of all
May have been that his heart was two sizes too small.
But, whatever the reason, his heart or his shoes,
He stood there on Christmas Eve hating the Whos,
Fahoo forays, dahoo dorays
Welcome Christmas! Come this way
Fahoo forays, dahoo dorays
Welcome Christmas, Christmas Day
Welcome, welcome, fahoo ramus
Welcome, welcome, dahoo damus
Christmas Day is in our grasp
So long as we have hands to clasp
Fahoo forays, dahoo dorays...
Why for fifty-three years I've put up with it now!
Then he got an idea! An awful idea!
The Grinch got a wonderful, awful idea!
Then he slid down the chimney, a rather tight pinch.
But if Santa could do it, then so could the Grinch.
Every Who down in Whoville, the tall and the small,
Was singing without any presents at all!
And what happened then? Well, in Whoville they say
That the Grinch's small heart grew three sizes that day!
Welcome Christmas while we stand
Heart to heart and hand in hand."
Youre Never Over,Eminem,2010,280255.0,https://genius.com/Eminem-Youre-Never-Over-lyrics,"I miss the days of old, thinkin' about you
If Proof could see me now, I know he'd be proud
Somewhere in me deep down, there's something in me he found
That made him believe in me, now no one can beat me now
So y'all can just get to bloggin' about bologna
I'm not gonna stop, the saga continues, no stoppin' the force, Obi
-E-R, just Blaze and me, we are knockin' on doors and no, we
Careful what you say, there ain't no punks over here, so follow me
Through the fog like I'm S-N-double-O-P, let me guide you through the smoke, G
I miss the days of old, thinkin' about you
For you I wanna write the sickest rhyme of my life
Guess that the best thing I can do right now, Doody, for you is to rap
But they'll never catch up to all this energy that I've mustered
So God, just help me out while I fight through this grievin' process
Tryna process this loss is makin' me nauseous
But this depression ain't takin' me hostage,
And I'ma show 'em, blow 'em out the water, slaughter 'em, homes
I'ma own so many belts, only place they can hit me is below 'em
You gave me a reason to fight, I was on my way to see you
You told me, ""Naw, Doody, you're not!""; layin' on that table, I knew
I was gonna make it; soon as you said, ""Think of Hailie"" I knew
There wasn't no way that I was ever gonna leave them babies;
and Proof
Not many are lucky enough to have a guardian angel like you
Lord, I'm so thankful, please don't think that I don't feel grateful, I do
So, homie, this is your song, I dedicate this to you
I love you, Doody
I miss the days of old, thinkin' about you"

Diplomatic Immunity,Drake,2018,1108951.0,https://genius.com/Drake-Diplomatic-Immunity-lyrics,"Diplomatic immunity, fuck 'em
All that peace and that unity
All that weak shit'll ruin me, fuck 'em, yeah
'Cause niggas started talkin' to me like I'm slowin' down
Opinions over statistics, of course
Gassed off journalistic
Come at me and all you'll get is the ballistic report
Booked a private room at Wally's, waiter twistin' the cork
I got multi-colored rings like the Olympics, of course
At award shows, cuttin' through the tension, of course
Girls huggin' me then askin' me, ""What scent that is, boy?""
I be walkin' around the Six like I invented it, boy
Yeah, who am I? The do or die
The one with the fewest lies and the truest ties
They try to compare us, but
Like a job straight outta high school there's no you and I
I taught you everything you know, now you got student pride
All factual, I call the house ""the embassy""
The studio ""the chapel"", I hate to travel
I just pulled up on Solána show, the girl's a natural
I knew her way back when Hollywood was international
Yeah, the furthest I've been, that's word to my ends
Word to the flags that belong in the hood of my Benz
Very presidential, I broke all the codes for zonin' in my residential
I broke spirits that I never meant to
My body isn't much of a sacred temple, with vodka and wine
And sleep at the opposite times
Promise shit is gettin' outta line like when you make a stencil
Or gettin' outta line like when you break a pencil
Violatin' the Treaty of Versailles
Champagne is the alias, but no cease and desist in I
I refuse to comply with regulations
I listen to heavy metal for meditation, no silence
Like Sanders on the Detroit Lions
Get a run around and I'll bury you where they won't find ya
Motor City Casino, I'm at the cage with my old license
They tell me ""don't worry, I got your money"" like Osirus
(I'm the Osiris of this shit)
Dirty 30, workin' on me
Tired of women that may tag me in pictures airin' my dirty laundry
Catering is from Giorgio Baldi, Robyn's favorite
Shit is nice, but I prefer Madeo
Calamari rings and tomato
I got the sauce and now shorties keep claimin' preggo
Wakin' up at 6 p.m. like, ""Where does the day go?""
Forecastin' tornadoes, brainstormin' retaliation at dinner tables
2010 was when I lost my halo
2017 I lost a J. Lo
A Rotterdam trip had me on front page though
I had to lay low, Hot Topic like your everyday clothes
Closed off but I could never stay closed
Billboard awards, I claimed 13 out in Vegas like Sureños
Black excellence, but I guess when it comes to me it's not the same though, all goodie
That just pushed me to do the things we all couldn't
Niggas stakin' out the crib, it's all gravy
Protection that God gave me
Shit is complex like short niggas 'round tall ladies
I gotta watch who I'm talkin' to like it's all-ages
I've seen buddin' careers turn to sit around and talk about other careers, judgin' their peers
Knowledge from niggas who did not contribute to none of this here
my security government tier
advance the venue so we know the exits
Tell 'em I don't wanna link like a broken necklace
I'll be in better company with my own reflection
Mirror, mirror, on the ceiling of my suite in the Royal Palace
The TV playin' Al Jazeera
Insha'Allah, I hope the mission keeps on gettin' clearer
Whenever, wherever, OVO will always be together like Shakira"

Another clever word sets off an unsuspecting herd
And as you step back in the line, a mob jumps to their feet
Now dance, fucker, dance,
man, he never had a chance
And no one even knew it was really only you
And now you steal away
You're gonna go far, kid
With a thousand lies and a good disguise
Hit 'em right between the eyes, hit 'em right between the eyes
When you walk away, nothing more to say
See the lightning in your eyes, see 'em running for their lives
Slowly outta line and drifting closer in your sight
So play it out, I'm wide-awake, it's a scene about me
There's something in your way
and now someone is gonna pay
And if you can't get what you want, well, it's all because of me
I never had a chance
And now you lead the way
Show the light of day
Trust deceived
Hit 'em right between the eyes, hit 'em right between the eyes
See the lightning in your eyes, see 'em running for their lives
Guitar Solo
Now dance, fucker, dance,
It was really only you
See the lightning in your eyes
Clever alibis, Lord of the Flies
Hit 'em right between the eyes, hit 'em right between the eyes

Is to get you, to know me, within sixteen bars
That's the hardest thing
Who is K. Dot?
A young nigga from Compton, on the curb writing raps next to a gunshot
On the corners where the gangsters and the killers dwell
Everyone I knew was either Crip or Piru
Cousins in elementary, relatives in high school
I needed survival
Got jumped, got jacked, shot at, shot back
They'll kill you if you kill me – it gets deep, nigga
I'm tryna duck the influence of my city that's brewing
Real talk, and
I was walking from Centennial
When an unidentified vehicle
Rolled up
And I was like ""Hol' up""
""Where you from?"" I don't bang
""Where you stay?""
Westside, that's a Piru gang, to be exact
Well aware they had blue across they hat
Dropped backpack and ran inside of the cul-de-sac
Chirped the homies on the I-95, they said they already knew
What happened, and meet 'em outside the garage
You my brother like a frat, and that's just to remind you""
I don't do black music, I don't do white music
I do everyday life music
And this is for my county building children
In Hub City on hubcaps, no power-steering
I use perseverance in this mad city
And land in the land of the AKs
And the minivans where the fan never on
'Cause it's hotter than a lunatic's underarms, in a straight jacket
In other words, we get it cracking
But I keep it cool,
An O.G. once told me
""A real gangster is either dead or in jail
Or behind the scenes getting real money""
I'm gone"

Left my girl in the house alone
Is that my soon-to-be-spouse's moan?
And the further I walk, the louder (

Pause for a minute to make certain that's what I heard
'Cause after all, this is her place
So I give her the benefit of the doubt, I
Think I might be about to bust her, bust her (

Hope it ain't, ""Here we go, yo!""

Here goes that broken record cliché
It's all my fault anyway, she's turnin' the tables, I'm a beat-break
Each day is an Instant Replay
They say what we display is symptomatic of addict behaviour
Bitch cut my fuckin' brakeline
Stepped on them fuckers eight times
Still goin' seventy-three
now here she comes at full speed
She's racin' at me, okay, you wanna fuck with me, eh?
Woke up again and jumped up
Like, ""Fuck it! I've had it, I'm checkin' into rehab""
Than the model covered in L'Oréal and mace
Who fell from grace eleven stories for storytellin'
While the whore was yellin', ""Rape!""
'Til her vocal cords were swellin'
And her voice were more hoarser than Tori Spellings' face
Still they swarm the gates of my fancy estates
To greet Norman Bates with a warm embrace
'Less you're Andrea Yates, don't ask me for a date though
You wanted an intimate date, I wanna intimidate

It's mainly 'cause of the game of— (*

Part I
]
It's like I'm in the dirt, diggin' up old hurt
Tried everything to get my mind off you, it won't work
All it takes is one song on the radio, you're
Right back on it,
reminding me all over again how you fuckin' just brushed me off and left me so burnt
Spent a lot of time tryna soul search
For the way that you turned your back on me
Just when I may have needed you most
You could just close the
Chapter and go about your life like it was nothing
You ruined mine, but you seem to be doin' fine
Well, I've never recovered
But tonight, bet you that what you're
Can't think of a better way to define poetic justice
Mind saying, ""Let it go, fuck this!""
Heart's saying, ""I will, once I bury this bitch alive
Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset""
I flee the scene (The scene) like it was my last ride
You see right through (Right through)
Oh, you had me pegged the first time
You can see the truth (The truth)
But it's easier to justify what's bad is good
And I hate to be the bad guy (The bad guy)
I just hate to be the bad guy (The bad guy)
Follow me (Follow me), I ruh-uh-un, follow me, I ruh-uh-un
I just hate to be the bad–
And to think I used to think you was the shit, bitch
To think it was you at one time I worshipped? Shit
Finish this stitch, so you can reap what you sew,
nitwit
You left our family in shambles
You expect me to just get over him, pretend he never existed?
May be gone but he's not forgotten
And don't think 'cause he's been out the picture so long that I've stopped the plotting and still ain't coming to get ya
You're wrong and that shit was rotten
And the way you played him's same shit you did to me, cold
Feelings I harbor? All this pent-up resentment I hold on to?
Letters, you don't respond to 'em
Fuck it, I'm coming to see you
And gee, who better to talk to than you?
Poof, then I'm gone, voosh
I flee the scene (The scene) like it was my last ride
You see right through (Right through)
Oh, you had me pegged the first time
You can see the truth (The truth)
But it's easier to justify what's bad is good
And I hate to be the bad guy (The bad guy)
I just hate to be the bad guy (The bad guy)
Follow me (Follow me), I ruh-uh-un, follow me, I ruh-uh-un
I just hate to be the bad guy
I've been drivin' around your side of this town
Like nine frickin' hours and forty-five minutes now
Feel like I've been waitin' on this moment all of my life
Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment
To come and see ya, but I ain't here for your empathy
I don't need your apology or your friendship or sympathy
It's revenge that I seek
So I sneak vengefully, and treat your bedroom window
Like I reach my full potential—I peeked (Haha)
Continue to peep, still bent low, then keep
Tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo, sneak
All the way 'round to the back porch
Man, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this
You don't plan for intruders beforehand?
Surprised to see me? Cat got your tongue?
Gag, chloroform rag, dag, almost hack-up a lung
Like you picked an axe up and swung, stick to the core plan
Dragged to the back of a trunk by one of your fans
Irony's spectacular, huh?
Now who's a faggot, you punk?
And here's your Bronco hat, you can have that shit back 'cause they suck
It's just me, you, and the music now, Slim, I hope you hear it
We're in a car right now—
wait, here comes my favorite lyric
""I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die""
And hey, here's a sequel to my Mathers LP just to try to get people to buy
How's this for a publicity stunt? This should be fun
Last album now 'cause after this you'll be officially done
Eminem killed by M and M, Matthew Mitchell
Bitch, I even have your initials
I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it
Since you're in love with your city so much, I figured, what the fuck, the best place you could be buried alive is right here
Two more exits, time is quite near
That sirens I hear?
Guess ninety on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea
As cops appear in my driver's side mirror
Hope Foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot, at least
New plan, Stan!
Slim: ""Chauvinist pig drove in this big Lincoln Town Car""
Well, gotta go, almost at the bridge
Ha ha, big bro, it's for you; Slim, this is for him
And Frank Ocean; oh, hope you can swim good
Now say you hate homos again
[
Part II
]
I also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend
I'm the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in
I'm your karma closin' in with each stroke of a pen
Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
Nope, it's hopeless, I'm that denial that you're hopelessly in
When they say all of this is approaching its end
But you refuse to believe that it's over, here we go all over again
Back's to the wall, I'm stackin' up all them odds
I am your lack of a conscience
I'm the ringing in your ears
I'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils
Eating your vocal cords after your concerts
I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged
Grab for some water
But I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow
I'm the bullies you hate that you became with every faggot you slaughtered comin' back on ya
Every woman you insult, batter, but the double-standard you have when it comes to your daughters
'Cause Marshall Mathers, the rapper's persona
Is half a facade,
and Matthew and Stan's just symbolic
Of you not knowin' what you had 'til it's gone
'Cause after all the glitz and the glam
No more fans that are calling your name
Cameras are off, sad, but it happens to all of them
When it's time to walk away, I'm every guilt trip
The baggage you have, but as you gather up all your possessions
If there's anything you have left to say
'Less it makes an impact then don't bother
So 'fore you rest your case better make sure you're packing a wallop (A wallop)
So, one last time, I'm back
'Fore it fades into black and it's all over
Tryna recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
Tragic portrait of an artist tortured
Trapped in his own drawings
Tap into thoughts blacker and darker than anything imaginable;
Uh, as we pick up where the last Mathers left off"

With a cap in his head and a knot in his tie
I'm the light in the mall when the power is gone
A shadow in the corner, just playing along
I'm only laying in my bed, I'm rolling aside
But if I get a car, I'm hoping to ride
Because I know if I ever say ""I'm leaving"" to you
You've got a folding chair, and you don't know what to do
You'd sigh
You wanna do it, but you don't know what you're doing, baby (A-a-a-a-aah)

And if you're thinking that I don't know what you're thinking, baby (A-a-a-a-aah)

Glock in the glove make you really wanna leave me, alone
Get the fuck on, gone
Okay, okay, okay, back to the happy song
Rap ain't nothing but the art of talkin' shit
My girl look pretty up there riding dick
My plaid past,
my solid future
Asinine ass and a gorgeous coochie
I'm an OutKast but you're into me

Everybody hit the floor, we through the roof
Like a chimney,
How come it be, some lame ass nigga talking about

But y'all rap a lot and I'm like ""Wrap it up, hoe""
You ain't Scarface,
you ain't Willie D
You ain't Bushwick, you ain't killin' me

Y'all white, know y'all can taste all

You ain't fresh squeezed juice, nigga you that Tang
Wait, is you really Slick Rick? Nope, you Dana Dane

And I always get away
But with you, I'm feeling somethin'
That makes me wanna stay

I'm prepared for this
I never shoot to miss
But I feel like a storm is comin'
If I'm gonna make it through the day
Then there's no more use in runnin'
This is somethin' I gotta face
If I risk it all
Could you break my fall?
How do I live? How do I breathe?
When you're not here, I'm suffocating
I wanna feel love run through my blood
Tell me, is this where I give it all up?
For you, I have to risk it all

That haunt me from my past
As the stars begin to gather
And the light begins to fade
When all hope begins to shatter
Know that I won't be afraid

Apple juice falling from her lips, took a little sip
Lil' sip, took a lil' sip
Took a lil' sip, t-took a lil', took a lil', took a lil' sip
Ayo, I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
Where niggas hold TECs like they mad at the ref
That's why I keep a cross on my chest, either that or a vest
Do you believe that Eve had Adam in check?
And if so, you gotta expect
To sip juice from the forbidden fruit and get loose
Cole is the king, most definite
My little black book thicker than the Old Testament
Niggas pay for head but the pussy sold separate
Same bitch giving brains to the minister
The same reason they call Mr. Cee the finisher
Forbidden fruit, watch for the Adam's apple
What you eat don't make me shit and who you fuck don't make me cum
Put a price on my head won't make me run
Try to kill me but it can't be done
'Cause my words gon' live forever
You put two and two together Cole here forever

I was a young nigga making A's at 11
Or 12, trying to get a taste of the Heaven
Or Hell, only time gon' tell
Fuck her while her mama home, ""baby, don't yell""
How many records do a nigga gotta sell
Just to get the cover of the XXL
Or Fader, fuck your magazine hater
When I say that I'm the greatest I ain't talking about later
I'ma drop the album same day as Kanye
Just to show the Boyz the man now like Wanyá
But this what's next, the boy sick, can't disinfect
Life's a bitch and her pussy's wet
My clip is loaded and this is the kiss of... death

The only man above me is God himself
All these other niggas is below me

That keeps your toys in the basement
But if you get too far inside
You'll only see my reflection
It's always best with the covers up
I am the pick in the ice
Do not cry out or hit the alarm
You know we're friends till we die
But either way you turn, I'll be there
Open up your skull, I'll be there
Climbing up the walls
It's always better on the outside
Fifteen blows to the back of your head
Fifteen blows to your mind
So lock the kids up safe tonight
Shut the eyes in the cupboard
I've got the smell of a local man
That either way he turns, I'll be there
Open up your skull, I'll be there

But we as entertainers have a responsibility to these kids
Psych!
If I were to die, murdered in cold blood tomorrow
Would you feel sorrow, show love, or would it matter?
Could never be the lead-off batter
If there ain't shit for me to feed off, I'm see-saw battlin'
But there's way too much at stake for me to be fake
There's too much on my plate
I done came way too far in this game to turn and walk away
And not say what I got to say
What the fuck you take me for, a joke? You smokin' crack?
'Fore I do that, I'd beg Mariah to take me back
I'll get up 'fore I get down, run myself in the ground
'Fore I put some wack shit out
I'm tryna smack this one out the park, five-thousand mark
Y'all steady tryna drown a shark
Ain't gon' do nothin' but piss me off
Fuck shootin', I'm just tryna knock his teeth out
Fuck with me now, bitch, let's see you freestyle
Talk is cheap
Motherfucker, if you really feelin' froggish, leap
""Yo, Slim, you gon' let him get away with that?
He tried to play you, you can't let him escape with that""
Man, I hate this crap
This ain't rap, this is crazy, the way we act
When we confuse hip-hop with real life when the music stops
The only way I'm leavin' this bitch is suicide
Arrived back at my enemy's crib with Hennessy
I spark willingly, with a Dillinger in the dark, diligently
(Bah)
I'll murder you, I gauge and have me turn into
A mad man, Son of Sam, bitch,
I'm surgical
I was happy havin' a deal at first
And you ain't got nothin' left but your word and your balls
Checkin' for your record when it's sellin'
When it ain't, that's the end: no laughs, no friends
No girls, just the gin you drink 'til your car spin
You think, ""Damn!""
Let's see how many of your men loyal
When I pull up lookin' for you with a pistol sippin' a can of Pennzoil
I'm revved up; who said what when lead bust?
You hype poppin' shit in broad daylight, nigga, you're a goner at night
Instigators
Proof, nigga, I'm a wolf
Get your whole roof caved in like reindeer hooves
It's Hill Street, this is hardcore blues
Put a gun to rap, check in all our dues, nigga
Or make the news, bet you all y'all move
When the Uzi pop, you better drop when the music stop
Music has changed my life in so many ways
Brain's confused, been fucked since the 5th grade
LL told me to rock the bells
N.W.A said ""Fuck tha Police,"" now I'm in jail
'93 was strictly R&B
Fucked up haircut, listened to Jodeci
Michael Jackson, who gon' tell me I ain't Mike?
Ass cheeks painted white, fuckin' Priscilla tonight
Transvestite in the front, Eddie Murphy in the back
M.O.P.
Marilyn Manson, I dyed my hair blue and grew some titties
Ludacris told me to throw them bows
I'm reachin' for the Glock, but the music stops"

Play Cloths, millionaire, trendsetter, landowner
D-Boys still ball the same, just gotta little bit of glam on it

Murder pink, murder what you thought and what you think

This that Category 5, this that quake, bitch, that quake, bitch
In Polo I'm stylin', it's all that I'm rockin'
Used to have a nigga that was down to get to clappin'
Seen it on a video, he yappin' to the captain
50 dollar, hundred dollar bill nigga shit
Got Mary blowing Jane
Diamond lane running thangs ain't shit you can tell us (Don't tell us nothing)
Just copped more .4 5's and 9's and I ain't talking bout no J's

Call this shit Hannibal Lecter

In the school of hard knocks I'm a fuckin' grad
In these Pumas I'ma run shit, high so I'm above shit
A Bathing Ape trucker, I'm a fly mothafucka
Remember I was shoppin' at Family Dollar
My hearse a 72442 with an all wood wheel and that bitch'll vert
My Oldmobile is a cold mobile
Niggas tryna get a brick of Kathy Lee Gifford
I'm kickin' it, I'm Liu Kang
I'm gangbanging 'til I break my fingers
'Til all my family members speak the slanguage
I ain't even drop no album yet
Off mixtapes, that's how I've been maintaining
Lyrically I am the epitome of a real MC
Biblically I am Timothy,
visually I am Tripoli
Full of bigotry, fighting with Gaddafi over liberty
sipping Hennessy
That's my only vice, old school noisy pipes
I ain't tryna be the richest, I'm cool with an M like Obie Trice
A one-hit wonder to your girl 'cause I came and went
The best thing to happen to the street since the sidewalk
Or the stop sign,
She ride three deep with molly in the middle
Put Micky Thompsons all on my Jeep
Her posse beat me by the threes, I call 'em Reggie Miller
She down with Slime, she got a tattoo of an anaconda
I'm cooking the Hannah Montana-na
I kill every one of my features, I spend all my money on divas
Bust it, in these Space Jams, I'm a Monstar
I'm on point like the state building
I stay sharper than razor blades
CUZ Lightyear
Lookin' like a fashion fossil, I'm Gianni reborn
When I smile for the photo looking like Lobo
Me and my bloodshot eyes, I pass on the Bud Light Lime
Just pass me that brew of St. Ides
Heat up on the holster, World's Fair! Yeah, you know us
11-36-8 be the zip code
Corona, Queens, nigga, that's what I call home
Ugh, ugh, got those motherfucking custom Roshes, feel me?
Swing the Dodge Viper lefty like I'm Randy Johnson
My mother wrist so cut look like it got bit by a grizzly
And these drugs got me spinning like some Capoeira
Still rock the slow beats with gold teeth, ain't afraid to hold heat
It's me
I built a fucking blueprint, like who the fuck you kidding?
You lames and you fall, I'm like 2 Chainz when I ball
Got Husseins on my feet and Husains on my wall
Hussein Chalayans, a pretty girl said that's fancy
hot as fuck, creme brûlée
King Midas, I can make gold with a touch
I promise to kill them all 'til everybody's missed
I'm from the Old New York
Where you got your chain snatched and your kicks tooken
Feared the sensei
I'm 7.0in' on Pitchfork
Tell Bron Bron we can bring the Heat back
go get ""Faith"", that's my last tape
Year before '83, I be the kid who found ET

Wish I was Jigga man, carefree livin'
But I'm not Shawn or Martin Louis
I'm that Cleveland nigga rollin' with them Brooklyn boys
I control my own life, Charles was never in charge
No sitcom could teach Scott about the dram'
Or even explain the troubles that haunted my mom
On Christmas time, my mom Christmas grind
Got me most of what I wanted, how'd you do it, Mom, huh?
She copped the toys I would play with in my room by myself
""Why he by himself?""
He got two older brothers; one hood, one good
An independent older sister kept me fly when she could
But they all didn't see
The little bit of sadness in me
Scotty
I've got some issues that nobody can see
And all of these emotions are pouring out of me
I bring them to the light for you, it's only right
This is the soundtrack to my life, the soundtrack to my life
I'm super paranoid, like a sixth sense
Since my father died, I ain't been right since
And I tried to piece the puzzle of the universe
Split an eighth of shrooms just so I could see the universe
I try and think about myself as a sacrifice
Just to show the kids they ain't the only ones who up at night
The moon will illuminate my room
And soon, I'm consumed by my doom
Once upon a time, nobody gave a fuck
It's all said and done and my cock's been sucked
So now I'm in the cut, alcohol in the wound
My heart's an open sore that I hope heals soon
I live in a cocoon opposite of Cancún
Where it is never sunny, the dark side of the moon
So it's more than right, I try and shed some light on a man
Not many people of this planet understand, fam
I've got some issues that nobody can see
And all of these emotions are pouring out of me
I bring 'em to the light for you, it's only right
This is the soundtrack to my life, the soundtrack to my life
I'm this close to go and trying some coke
And a happy ending would be slittin' my throat
Ignorance to cope, man, ignorance is bliss
Ignorance is love and I need that shit
If I never did shows then I'd prolly be a myth
If I cared about the blogs then I'd prolly be a jackass
fam
Haters shake my hand but I keep the sanitizer on deck
Hope I really get to see 30
Most of the clean faces be the most dirty
brain is insanity
Only things that calm me down; pussy, and some Cali tree
I am happy, that's just the saddest lie
I've got some issues that nobody can see
And all of these emotions are pouring out of me
I bring 'em to the light for you, it's only right
This is the soundtrack to my life, the soundtrack to my life"

Hold on to hope if you got it
Don't let it go for nobody
They say that dreaming is free
But I wouldn't care what it cost me
You got me tied up, but I stay close to the window
And I talk to myself about the places that I used to go
I'm hoping someday maybe I'll just float away
And I'll forget every cynical thing you say
When you gonna hear me out?
Man, you really bring me down
Hold on to hope if you got it
Don't let it go for nobody

But I wouldn't care what it cost me
Reality will break your heart
Survival will not be the hardest part
It's keeping all your hopes alive
When all the rest of you has died

(""Who's your daddy?"")
I don't have one
My mother reproduced like the komodo dragon
then crashed in
The side of loco-motive with rap, I'm
Loco,
Michelangelo with a paint gun in a tantrum
'Bout to explode all over the canvas
Back with the Yoda of rap, ""In a spasm
Your music usually has 'em
Follow you must, Rick Rubin my little Padawan.""
Probably find a way to complain about a Picasso painting
Puke Skywalker,
but sound like Chewbacca when I talk
Full of such blind rage, I need a seein' eye dog
Can't even find the page I was writing this rhyme on
Oh, it's on the ram-page
Couldn't see what I wrote, I write small
It says, ""Ever since I drove a '79 Lincoln with whitewalls
Had a fire in my heart
And a dire desire to aspire
to Die Hard.""
So as long as I'm on the clock, punching this time card
Hip-hop ain't dying on my watch
Now sometimes when I'm sleepin'
She comes to me in my dreams
(""Who's your daddy?"")
I don’t know him, but I wonder—
(""Is he rich like me?"")
Ha
Makes you want to get up and start dancin'
Even if it is Charles Manson
blue lights flashin'
Laughin' all the way to the bank, lampin' in my K-Mart mansion
I’m in the style department
With a pile in my cart, rippin' the aisle apart but
With great power comes
Absolutely no responsibility
for content
Completely despondent and condescending
The king of nonsense and controversy
Rebel without a cause
(""Hip-hop is the Devil's music"")
Does that mean it belongs to me?
'Cause I just happen to be a white honky devil with two horns
That don't honk but every time I speak you hear a beep
But lyrically I never hear a peep, not even a whisper
Rappers better stay clear of me, bitch, 'cause it's the—

(""Has he taken any time to show you what you need to live?"")
But I bet we wouldn't probably get one block
Without me knocking your block off,
Maybe that's why I'm so bananas I appealed to all those walks
Of life, whoever had strife
Maybe that's what dad and son talks are like
'Cause I related to the struggles of young America
When their fucking parents were unaware of their troubles
I chuckle as everybody bloodies their bare knuckles
The sign of my hustle says:
""Don't knock”, the door's broken, it won't lock
It might just fly open, get cold-cocked
You critics come to pay me a visit?
Misery loves company, please stay a minute
Kryptonite to a hypocrite
Zip your lip if you dish it but can't take it
Too busy gettin' stoned in your glass house
To kick rocks,
Completely brain-dead: Rain Man
Doing a Bankhead in a restraint chair
So, bitch, shoot me a look, it better be a blank stare
Or get shanked in the pancreas
I'm angrier than all eight other reindeer
Put together with Chief Keef 'cause I hate every fuckin' thang, yeah
But I still am a ""Criminal""
The last

Moment of Truth,Gang Starr,1998,407348.0,https://genius.com/Gang-Starr-Moment-of-Truth-lyrics,"[Intro: Sharon]
No matter what we face
We must face the moment of truth, baby
They say it's lonely at the top, and whatever you do –
The same sheisty cats that you hang with, and do your thang with
Could set you up and wet you up, nigga, peep the language
You know I be the master of the who, what, where, and why
See when you're shining, some chumps'll wanna dull ya
Always selfish, jealous punks will wanna pull ya–
Down, just like some shellfish in a bucket
'Cause they love it, to see your ass squirm like a worm
That everyone must meet their moment of truth
Sometimes you gotta dig deep, when problems come near
Don't fear, things get severe for everybody, everywhere
Why do bad things happen to good people?
To think such problems can arise from minor confrontations
Don't even feel like drinkin' or even gettin' high
'Cause all that's gonna do really, is accelerate–
The anxieties that I wish I could alleviate
But, wait – I've been through a whole lot of other shit before
So, I oughta be able to withstand some more
But, I'm sweatin' though, my eyes are turnin' red and yo –
I'm ready to lose my mind, but instead, I use my mind
I put down the knife, and take the bullets out my 9
My only crime–was that I'm too damn kind
And now some scandalous motherfuckers wanna take what's mine
So like they say, every dog has its day
And like they say, God works in a mysterious way
""You shall know truth, and the truth shall set you free!""
Yo, I got one lyric pointed at your head, for start
Another one–is pointed at your weak-ass heart
Now if I pull the trigger, on these fully-loaded lines
You're gonna wish I would've pulled a black 9
Revolvin' on the TASCAM, much doper than my last jam
While others struggle to juggle tricky metaphors
I explore more, to expose the core
You dig it and you dug it, 'cause like money you love it
Throw up your He Allah Now, Divine Saviors
No pager, no celly, no drop-top Benz-y
I came to bring your phony hip-hop to an ending
My art of war will leave you sore from the abuse"
American Pie,Don McLean,1971,2445423.0,https://genius.com/Don-McLean-American-Pie-lyrics,"A long, long time ago
I can still remember how that music
Used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while
But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step
I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
But something touched me deep inside
The day the music died
So, bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
And them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin', ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""
Did you write the book of love?
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Now, do you believe in rock 'n' roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?
Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues
I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singin', bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin', ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""
Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rollin' stone
But that's not how it used to be
When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me
Oh, and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned
And while Lenin read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died
We were singin', bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin', ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""
Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and fallin' fast
It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast
Now, the halftime air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance
'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?
We started singin', bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin', ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""
Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again
So, come on, Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the Devil's only friend
Oh, and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan spell
And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
He was singin', bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin', ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""
I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away
I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play
And in the streets, the children screamed
The lovers cried and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken
And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
And there I stood alone and afraid
I dropped to my knees and there I prayed
And I promised Him everything I could give
If only He would make the music live
And He promised it would live once more
But this time one would equal four
And in five years four had come to mourn
And the music was reborn
And they were singin', bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin', ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""
They were singin', bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin', ""This'll be the day that I die"""

Hangin' out with young thugs that all carry nines
And night time is more trife than ever

Say what's up to Herb, Ice and Bullet
I left a half a hundred in your commissary
Dear Born, you'll be out soon, stay strong
Hold, check out the story yesterday when I was walkin'
That nigga you shot last year tried to appear like he hurtin' somethin'
Word to mother, I heard him frontin'
And he be pumpin' on your block, your man gave him your Glock
And now they run together — what up, son? Whatever
But I heard you blew a nigga with a ox for the phone piece
Wildin' on the Island, but now in Elmira
Better chill, 'cause them niggas will put that ass on fire
Last time you wrote, you said they tried you in the showers
But maintain, when you come home, the corner's ours
But chill, see you on the next V.I
I gave your mom dukes loot for kicks, plus sent you flicks
Your brother's buckwildin' in 4-Main, he wrote me
I hate it when your moms cries
It kinda makes me want to murder, for real-a
I even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs, but one love
Sometimes I sit back with a Buddha sack
Mind's in another world, thinkin', ""How can we exist through the facts?""
Written in school textbooks, bibles, et cetera
Fuck a school lecture, the lies get me vexed-er
So I be ghost from my projects
I take my pen and pad for the weekend, hittin' L's while I'm sleepin'
A two-day stay, you may say I needed time alone
To relax my dome, no phone, left the nine at home
You see the streets had me stressed somethin' terrible
Fuckin' with them corners have a nigga up in Bellevue
Or HDM, hit with numbers from eight to ten
A future in a maximum state pen is grim
So I comes back home, nobody's out but Shorty Doo-Wop
Rollin' two phillies together, in the 'Bridge, we call 'em ""oo-wops""
He inhaled so deep, shut his eyes like he was 'sleep
Started coughin', one eye peeked to watch me speak
We was chillin' on these benches where he pumped his loose cracks
I took the L when he passed it, this little bastard
Keeps me blasted and starts talkin' mad shit
I had to school him, told him don't let niggas fool him
'Cause when the pistol blows, the one that's murdered be the cool one
Left some jewels in his skull that he can sell if he chose
Words of wisdom from Nas: Try to rise up above
Keep an eye out for Jake, shorty wop, one love"

It's so crazy, I could drink it like tequila sunrise
Put on that ""Hotel California""
Dance around like I'm insane
I feel free when I see no one
And nobody knows my name
God knows I lived
God knows I died
God knows I begged
Begged, borrowed, and cried
God knows I loved
God knows I lied
God knows I lost
God gave me life
And God knows I tried
God knows I tried
God knows I tried
God knows I tried
Sometimes, I wake up in the morning
To red, blue, and yellow lights
On Monday, they destroy me
But, by Friday, I'm revived

Wear my blinders in the rain
I've got nothing much to live for
Ever since I found my fame

God knows I died

God knows I begged
Begged, borrowed, and cried
God knows I lost

He liked Maycomb, he was Maycomb County born and bred; he knew his people, they knew him, and because of Simon Finch's industry, Atticus was related by blood or marriage to nearly every family in the town.

The house was low, was once white with a deep front porch and green shutters, but had long ago darkened to the color of the slate-gray yard around it. Rain-rotted shingles drooped over the eaves of the veranda; oak trees kept the sun away. The remains of a picket drunkenly guarded the front yard- a ""swept"" yard that was never swept-where johnson grass and rabbit-tobacco grew in abundance.

Jem gave a reasonable description of Boo: Boo was about six-and-a-half feet tall, judging from his tracks; he dined on raw squirrels and any cats he could catch, that's why his hands were bloodstained- if you ate an animal raw, you could never wash the blood off. There was a long jagged scar that ran across his face; what teeth he had were yellow and rotten; his eyes popped, and he drooled most of the time.

My Crips lurking, don't die tonight
I just want to dance with you, baby
Just don't move too fast, I'm too crazy
Man down, Downey Ave, it gets shady
Take a nigga mind off that
We can dip, fuck in the whip, slide right back in the function
One wrong word, start busting
Put that on my Yankee hat
I'm a gangsta Crip, fuck gangsta rap
Where the ladies at? Where the hoes? Where the bitches?
Every real nigga know the difference
Bandana brown like the dope daddy shooting in the kitchen
Real Norfside nigga, never went to Poly, Wilson, or Cabrillo
Cocaine color of a Creole
T-Skrap moving for the D-low, and he know
I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
From the city where the skinny carry strong heat
Norfside, Long Beach (Norfside, Long Beach)
Hit the corner, make a dollar flipping
Split the dollars with my mama children
Folks need Porsches, hoes need abortions
I just need y'all out of my business
Never no problem playing no bitches
Never no problem spraying no witnesses
No face, no case, been with the shit
Hopped out broad day, then emptied clips
Cut class 'cause it wasn't 'bout cash
School wasn't no fun, couldn't bring my gun
Know a change gon' come like Obama 'nem say
But they shooting everyday 'round my mama 'nem way
So we put an AK where Kiana and them stay
And that's for any nigga say he got a problem with me
How I'm Cripping where I'm living, come and follow me
Pistol popping, Poppy Street
I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
From the city where the skinny carry strong heat
Norfside, Long Beach (Norfside, Long Beach)
Nate Dogg still here 'cause of niggas like me
Police still scared 'cause of niggas like me
In the hood, like a dollar sweet tea or a Louis Burger
You ain't with the business, nigga, who you murdered?
You ain't heard of Coldchain? Best thang smokin' out the city
Riding 'round with the same shotgun that shot Ricky
Lil' nigga should've zig-zagged, then he got his back wet
Naughty running Norfside, niggas better fact-check
Fronting with the gun talk, I ain't heard a clap yet
All my niggas from the street, they the niggas best yet
'Cept for Lil' Halftime, brody bang the Five Blocks
Sorry, I hit your homie five times, better grab chalk
Did it, got away with it out the Civic
We Cripping, Long Beach City, pay a visit
Park Ramona, Pop-block the corner
Giving hell 'til it's frozen over
I ain't never ran from nothing
I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
I ain't never ran from nothing but the police

See a nigga on Dayton's and we creep
With six niggas in a car; are you crazy?
She was scared, and it was showin'
We all said, ""Fuck you, bitch!"" and kept goin'
A bum rush, but we call it rat pack
On a nigga for nothin' at all
Ice Cube'll go stupid when I'm full of eight ball
I might stumble, but still won't lose
Now I'm dressed in the county blues
Wait a minute, wait a minute, cut this shit!

What we're gonna do right here is go back

""As we go a lil' somethin' like this — hit it!""
Here's a little gangsta, short in size
A t-shirt and Levi's is his only disguise
Built like a tank, yet hard to hit
Well, I'm Eazy-E, the one they're talkin' about
Nigga tried to roll the dice and just crapped out
I creeped away real slow and jumped in the six-fo'
With the (diamond in the back, sun-roof top)
Diggin' the scene with the gangsta lean
'Cause I'm the E, I don't slang or bang
I just smoke motherfuckers like it ain't no thang!

 I wanna fuck you too!

Stand up beside the fireplace
Take that look from off your face
You ain't ever gonna burn my heart out

She knows it's too late as we're walkin' on by
Her soul slides away

Do I owe each kiss to lip and cheek
As soft as Chet can sing ""Let's Get Lost""?

Let smoke rings from this paper, doll
Blow sweet and thick till every thought of it don't mean a thing

I laugh like me again, she laughs like you

So I hope you know, you ain't the only reason I'm emotional

Not like I was before
Tryna make a change, I need something more

Hope you don't think I still won't ride for mine
Every rose needs the rain sometimes
But know that you can dry your eyes this time
Let the song cry
What am I s'posed to do?
Hold it all together when I think of you?
When in my heart I'm thinking you were gone too soon
May you rest in peace, yet I can't sleep
'Cause my point of view
Got me in a state of mind, I'm so confused
Crying raindrops so that I can bloom
So what am I to do?

Fuck, let's get it
I may be cryin' now but I'll be laughin' later
Knew it wouldn't be easy when you're tryna be the greatest
That ever did it or does it
Ain't no fuckin' time for later
And I know they think I'm sporadic
The bastard child of an addict
But I'm way too calculated
I try to love, but I never knew it
This money, I'm blowin' through it
Ain't rockin' red or blue, I'm unafilliated
'Cause my bloods and my cousins hate me
I try to buy my mama's love, she don't appreciate it
So I stay inebriated
I figured maybe J.Cole or Drizzy Drake
Would drop a verse and tell the people how we hurtin'
Guess I was mistaken
This moment mine for the takin'
For all them nights I thought of suicide, contemplatin'
I can't hold back these tears, let me cry
They say a man ain't supposed to cry
So I'ma let the song cry
I'ma let my soul cry through these words
I need to try to free my mind
Sometimes I need to cry just to ease my hurt
But when I let the song cry
Hope you don't think I still won't ride for mine

Two trailer-park girls go round the outside
Round the outside, round the outside
Two trailer-park girls go round the outside
Round the outside, round the outside
Woo (Ooh, ooh)
Guess who's back, back again?
Shady's back, tell a friend
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back
I've created a monster
'Cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more, they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well, if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump-start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not cooperating
When I'm rockin' the table while he's operating (Hey)
You waited this long, now stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They tried to shut me down on
MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that, cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready, 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits (Fuck you, Debbie)
Now, this looks like a job for me
So, everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So, everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feelin' like prisoners, helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, ""Bitch""
A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, pollutin' the airwaves
A rebel
so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissin' my ass
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass, you asked for me?
Well, I'm back, da-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in,
the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?
Now, this looks like a job for me
So, everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So, everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
A tisket, a tasket, I'll go tit-for-tat wit'
Anybody who's talkin', ""This shit, that shit""
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You thirty-six-year-old bald-headed fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno
Now, let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But, sometimes, the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do Black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey)
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'd be so empty without me
Now, this looks like a job for me
So, everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So, everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

You dig?
We the lost symbols,
speak in cryptic codes
Ancient wisdom valuable like gifts of gold
I embark on life, my path is all math
I understand that folks expect me to fold
Community control to violate parole (No)
I won't fail, but a lot of men will
I'm iconic in the field like Solomon's Seal (Woo)
Allow my flow time to sink into the tempo
Free agents (Me), we faster (Ha)
Built pyramids,
period, we masters
A lot of great thinkers and a lot of great inventors
All-black diamonds, times were hard (Woo)
My top back like JFK
They wanna push my top back like JFK (Ayy)
So— So I ""JFK""
Join forces with the kings
I stopped writing, so fuck it, I'll do it mentally
Niggas couldn't do nothing with me, they put the devil on me
I'd have preferred niggas to squeeze the metal on me
Rumors of Lucifer, I don't know who to trust
Whole world want my demise—turn the music up
Hear me clearly: If y'all niggas fear me, just say y'all fear me
Fuck all these fairytales
Go to Hell, this is God engineering
This is a Hail Mary pass, y'all interfering
He without sin shall cast the first stone
So y'all look in the mirror, double-check your appearance
Bitch, I said I was amazing
Not that I'm a Mason
It's amazing that I made it through the maze that I was in
Lord, forgive me, I never would've made it without sin
Holy water, my face in the basin
Diamonds in my Rosary shows He forgave him
Bitch, I'm red-hot
I'm on my third six, but a devil I'm not
My Jesus-piece flooded
But thou shall not covet—keep your eyes off my cupboard
I'm a bad motherfucker, it's Hov, just say you love it
If I ever die
Never let it be said I didn't win"

Be careful what you wish for
I stuck my dick in this game like a rapist
They call me Slim Roethlisberger
I go berserker than a fed-up post office worker
I murk her with a Mossberg,
For a gangster, you sure did shit your pants
When you saw the chainsaw get to waving like a terrible towel
Get your brains blown out, that's what I call blowin' your mind
When I come back, like nut on your spine
Now here I come, screaming ""Attack!"" like I just stepped on one
defiance, giant scrotum
He's so out cold, he's knocked out at the South Pole
rigor mortis and post mortem
He's dyin' of boredom
Take your best rhymes, record 'em, then try to thwart him
He'll just take your punch lines and snort 'em
Shit-stained drawers, you gon' fuck with a guy
Who licks the blades of his chainsaws
While he dips 'em in P.F. Chang's sauce?
Game's up, homie, hang it up like some crank calls
You think I'm backin' down?
You must be out of your dang skulls; I'm almost famous

I'm back for revenge, I lost a battle, that ain't happenin' again
I'm at your throat like strep, I step, strapped with a pen
Metaphors wrote on my hand, some are just stored in my memory
Some I wrote on a napkin, I do what I have to to win
Pullin' out all stops
any who touch a mic prior's
Not even Austin Powers, how the fuck are they Mike Myers?
Now get off my dick! Dick's too short of a word for my dick
Get off my antidisestablishmentarianism, you prick!
Don't call me the Champ, call me the Space Shuttle Destroyer
I just blew up the Challenger; matter fact, I need a lawyer
I just laced my gloves with enough plaster to make a cast
Beat his ass naked and peed in his corner like Verne Troyer
Y'all are Eminem backwards: you're Mini Mes
See, he's in a whole nother weight class
He's slugs, you're BBs: you're bean-bag bullets
You're full of it, you were dissin' his CD's
Laughed at
Infinite, n
ow he's back like someone pissed in his Wheaties
No peace treaties, he's turned into a beast
His new
Slim Shady EP
's got the attention of the mighty D.R.E
He's almost famous
I have been changing faces
there is too much to lose
I just wanna be famous, but...
Be careful what you wish for
He ain't givin' them shit, he says he'll pinch a penny so hard
He'll leave a bruise on the bronze so dark you can see the mark
With the scars, 'til Abraham Lincoln is screamin' out, ""Ahh!""
These metaphors and similes ain't similar to them, not at all
If they don't like it, they can all get fucked
Instead of suckin' him off
They can go get a belt or a neck tie to hang themselves by
Like David Carradine, they can go fuck themselves and just die
The bullies become bullied, and pussies get pushed
Then they better pull me, take me back to 9th grade to school me
'Cause I ain't lookin' back, only forward, this whole spot blowin'
And while I'm bein' poetic, let me get it stoic and raise the bar
Higher than my opinion of these women's been lowered
there's a cold wind blowin'"

It don't matter if you got six dollars or six figures on the creep
'Cause in the end we all six feet deep
Meanwhile, I'll be immortalized on a 6ix beat
Flashbacks of havin' visions way back in G'Burg
Every single one of my homies and me work
Cuttin' had to get up out it, make a hit, forget about it
Youngin' wit' a dream but nobody gave a shit about it
Ten years later, pick up the pen, write a hit about it
And back then, I thought I'd be defined by how good I rhyme
Not like these rappers with shit flows, but look good online
Not made to feel bad for speakin' bout this shit on my mind
Or called a faggot, a nig

I wish I could face my homophobic, racist attacker

Nobody reports the music, this shit, this rap TMZ
Wash my hands of this negativity, word to Three Stacks
So fresh, so clean, who the illest on the scene?
Wu-Tang, get the cream
Open your mental, get out your feelin's like dental
Fuck a rap beef, I promise I want all of y'all to prosper
But deep down you know it's only gon' be one Mufasa
I'm the king, fuck the bling, but just might make you kiss the ring
All these rappers I came up on, I surpassed, I know it sting now
Dropped my last shit, the whole wide world applauded it
I'm heartless like Kanye in '08
Yeah, that's word to NO I.D, now they all know who I be
I'm callin' out Jay-Z to jump up on the track with me and smack the whole industry
Show 'em what that real rap do
The ball's in your court, Hov, I hope to hear from Guru, woo!"

No sports bra, let's keep it bouncin'
Everybody wanna live at the top of the mountain
Took her to the 'Bleau, she tried to sip the fountain

Anyone else would retire, but I'm not content
I wanna bury these niggas like twenty feet down so no one can find them again
Got a verse from the boy and it leaked (Fuck)
He sent me a new one, said use it instead (Use it)

Bitin' my style, you're salmonella poison positive
Milk the game up, never lactose intolerant
The last remainder of real shit, you know the obvious

Be all you can be, true, but the problem is
Dream only a dream if work don't follow it
K Dizzle will do it for you, my niggas think I'm a god

He was five-foot somethin', God bless the kid
Took his homies to the show and this is what they said:
""Fuck am I 'posed to do when I'm lookin' at walkin' licks?

Quickly because he got it
It's a recession, then why the fuck he at King of Diamonds?
No more livin' poor, meet my four-four
When I see 'em, put the per diem on the floor
Now Kendrick, know they're your co-workers
But it's gon' take a lot 'fore this pistol go cold turkey
Now I can watch his watch on the TV and be okay
But see I'm on the clock once that watch landin' in LA
""Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga

Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga
He was five-foot something, dazed and confused
Talented but still under the neighborhood ruse
You can take your boy out the hood
But you can't take the hood out the homie
Took his show money, stashed it in the mozey wozey
Hollywood's nervous

Adaptation,The Weeknd,2013,713283.0,https://genius.com/The-Weeknd-Adaptation-lyrics,"When the sun comes up, you're searching for a love
So your heart won't lead you to anyone
When the sun goes down, I know what you become
You become awake, unlike the rest of us
[Sample]
The afternoon has gently passed me by
The evening spreads its sail against the sky
Waiting for tomorrow
Just another day
As I bid yesterday goodbye
I lay my head on a thousand beds
I think I lost the only piece that held it all in place
Now my madness is the only love I let myself embrace
But I chose the lie
I chose the life
Then I realized
She might've been the one
I let it go
For a little fun
I made a trade
Gave away our days
For a little fame
Now I'll never see your face
But it's okay, I adapted anyway
Adapted to these models
Who's adapted to the bottle
They take it down like water
Just to burn away their sorrows
And clean, so clean, as opposed to what I offered
Because I chose the lie
I chose the life
Then I realized
She might've been the one
I let it go
For a little fun
I made a trade
Gave away our days
For a little fame
Now I'll never see your face
But it's okay, I adapted anyway
She might just be the one
She might just be the one (Oh, baby)
She might just be the one
She might just be the one

Burning holes in the nighttime
Open scars feel like barbed wire
White lies flying high like a ceasefire
Dropping flags on the shoreline
This is as far as I can feel right
'Cause what you don't know
Can haunt you
And all we ever wanted
Was sunlight and honesty
Highlights to wanna repeat
Let's get away from here and
Live like the movies do
I won't mind when it's over
At least I didn't think for a while
(Don't drag it out, living like that doesn’t mean a thing)
So let's run
Make a great escape
And I'll be waiting outside for the getaway
We'll keep running through the dark
And all we'll ever need is another day
We can slow down 'cause tomorrow is a mile away
And live like shooting stars
'Cause happy endings hardest to fake
Yeah
Polaroids and OutKast
And I won't mind when it's over
At least I didn't think for a while
But I just can't bring myself to speak
But this is how it goes
The end credits, they roll
This bridge was built over kerosene
But we can watch it burn—
'Cause you can wish away forever
But you'll never find a thing like today"
Phenomenal,Eminem,2015,692775.0,https://genius.com/Eminem-Phenomenal-lyrics,"Unstoppable, unpoppable thought bubbles
Untoppable thoughts, fuckin' juggernaut that'll
Stomp you in a verse, obstacles I'm drawn to 'em
When the going got rough
Some of what I done fought through was the worst, little sissy
Who the fuck taught you how to persevere?
There ain't no situation that you ever had to respond to that's adverse
The messiest thing you've ever gone through was your purse
Yeah, I don't try like hell, then I might as well
Hang it up like a shelf,
gotta keep growin' with it, evolve
Cause you can keep throwin' shit at the wall
But you're gonna find that nothing's gonna stick until you apply yourself
Time to slip in that zone 'til I find myself
Inside the realm of the unknown and boldly go
Into waters where nobody else has gone before
Or willing to go, uncharted, feeling is so
Bomb,
I'm feelin' myself, I'm a giant
Sometimes I gotta remind myself that I am...
Now what you do is put the match to the charcoal fluid
Put the spark to it like Martha Stewart barbecuing
Ah screw it, feel like you want to hit that wall then do it
Punch through it, just cock back, put your all into it
Now you gon' take that rage and make that what you wage
Never take back what you say
If you stay strapped in your brain, engaged in a steel cage match
Ready to scrap asap
Take your fists and just ball it
Show who's big and who's smallest you're Christopher Wallace
Now picture 'em all as plastic and foam
Lays flat, where you put your dinner plates at
And set it on 'em like a placemat
And I want you to say that
Oh, step into the unknown and find yourself
You’re floating freely, no emotion
Got a fuckin’ mouth with no shut-off valve
Can't even cut off power to it, but it's what allowed
Me to come up out from under the fuckin' ground
Cause I worked my butt off now
It's a subject that I don't know how to shut up about
Cause I stuck it out
Like a motherfuckin' tongue thats how
I responded when I got shoved around
You're gonna have non-believers
But when you're beyond belief, you probably shouldn't wonder how
Get it how you live
But are you prepared to give more than you get?
And put in twice what you get back from this shit
Though what you sacrifice barely is half, never give
Rap is my shiv
But it's like my shield at the same time I wield and my knife is will
Sometimes I feel just like B. Real from Cypress Hill
How I can just kill a cypher, survivor's guilt
I rhyme like life is still an uphill climb
Ready to face any challenge, waitin'
Can taste it, it's salivation, I'm wagin' retaliation
I write with the left, same hand I hold the mic with
As I fight to the death, 'til my last breath
Manage to prove who the best man is
Prevail at all costs, be the only ones left standin'
In the end, but I ain't gonna be the only one with the advantage
Of knowin' what it's like to be southpaw
Cause you can bet your ass you'll be left handed
Cause I am"

You say you wanna move on and
You say I'm falling behind

I never really gave up on
Breaking out of this two-star town
I got the green light, I got a little fight
I'm gonna turn this thing around
Can you read my mind?
The good old days, the honest man
The restless heart, the Promised Land
A subtle kiss that no one sees
A broken wrist and a big trapeze
I don't mind if you don't mind
'Cause I don't shine if you don't shine
Before you go, can you read my mind?
It’s funny how you just break down
Waiting on some sign
I pull up to the front of your driveway
With magic soaking my spine
The teenage queen, the loaded gun
The drop dead dream
A southern drawl, a world unseen
A city wall and a trampoline
Cause I don't shine if you don't shine
Slipping in my faith until I fall
He never returned that call
Woman, open the door, don't let it sting
I wanna breathe that fire again
Put your back on me, put your back on me (I don't mind, if you don't mind)

And my thoughts got rude
as you talked and chewed
On the last of your pick and mix
Said, ""You're mistaken if you're thinking
That I haven't been called cold before""
As you bit into your strawberry lace
And then offered me your attention in the form of a gobstopper
It's all you had left and it was going to waste
Your pastimes consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I love that little game you had called
Crying Lightning
And how you'd like to aggravate the ice-cream man
On rainy afternoons
The next time that I caught my own reflection
It was on its way to meet you
Thinking of excuses to postpone
You never looked like yourself from the side
But your profile could not hide
The fact you knew I was approaching your throne
With folded arms you occupied the bench like toothache
Stood and puffed your chest out like you'd never lost a war
And though I tried so not to suffer the indignity of reaction
There was no cracks to grasp or gaps to claw
And your pastimes consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I hate that little game you had called
Crying Lightning
And how you'd like to aggravate the icky man on rainy afternoons
Uninviting,
but not half as impossible as everyone assumes you are

Dance with the Devil,Immortal Technique,2001,1959899.0,https://genius.com/Immortal-Technique-Dance-with-the-Devil-lyrics,"I once knew a nigga whose real name was William
but for every year she was sober
Her son's heart simultaneously grew colder
Checkin' the young chicks, lookin' for hit-and-run prospects
But he understood money never bought respect
You see, me and niggas like this have never been equal
He fiended for props like addicts with pipes and needles
Ask a nigga doin' life if he had another chance
But then again, there's always the wicked that knew in advance
Devils used to be God's angels that fell from the top
There's no diversity because we're burning in the melting pot
Fulfillin' the
Scarface
 fantasy stuck in his brain
Any nigga with a red shirt can front like a Blood
Even Puffy smoked a motherfucker up in the club
Devils used to be God's angels that fell from the top
There's no diversity because we're burning in the melting pot
They drove around the projects slow while it was rainin'
So Billy stomped on the bitch until he'd broken her jaw
The dirty bastards knew exactly what they were doin'
They kicked her until they cracked her ribs and she stopped movin'
Her broken jaw mumbled for God, but they weren't concerned
And if he killed her, he was guaranteed a spot in the crew
I'm fallin' and I can't turn back
I'm fallin' and I can't turn back
'Cause he was starin' into the eyes of his own mother
His corruption had successfully changed his fate
And so he jumped off the roof and died with no soul
They say death takes you to a better place, but I doubt it
And listen, 'cause the story that I'm tellin' is true
'Cause I was there with Billy Jacobs, and I raped his mom too
And now the Devil follows me everywhere that I go
So when the Devil wants to dance with you, you better say never
Because a dance with the Devil might last you forever
Yo, Diabolic, take this motherfucker's head off!
your worship defeat the purpose
Like President Bush takin' bullets for the secret service
Show no compassion, like havin' a straight-faced orgasm
Diabolic—a one-man brigade spreading cancer plague
Fist-fuckin' a pussy's face, holdin' a hand grenade
I just had to get that stress off my chest like breast reduction
I'll resurrect every aborted baby and start an army
You're faker than blue-eyed crackers nailed to a crucifix
Arsenic language transmitted revolutionarily
I'm like time itself—I'm gonna kill you inevitably
Chemically bomb you, fuck usin' a chrome piece
I'm Illmatic, you won't make it home, like Jerome's niece
And your crew is full of more faggots than Greek mythology
Produces more digits than twenty-two divided by seven
You're like Kevin Spacey—your style is usually suspect
You never killed a cop, you not a motherfuckin' thug yet
you're never gonna make it
Like children walkin' through Antarctica butt-naked"

I guess it's my fault, I know what's up
Baby, we used to fuck
From now on, we make love
Girl, let's catch up, phone calls ain't enough
That's where I messed up, I shoulda kept in touch
Cause I ain't the type that will hit it and quit it
Even if it's mine, even if it isn't

Ain't layin' naked in my sheets no more

Talk less, that's what I was on

Ayy, quick to admit it when I'm wrong
Instead, I was leading you on
Now it's fuck me and leave you alone
Come love me, I need you at home

I've been peepin' hard, on some stalker shit
I'm feenin' hard, that's the obvious, yeah

Feelin' on somethin', talkin' 'bout nothin'
Then maybe later you and I discuss it, mmm
Do you feel like I do? Can I know?
Clearly, baby, it's you that I want
Listen, I don't wanna confuse you
Don't ever think that I use you
Give me one more chance, I'll prove you wrong
How you want it to go? We can do this slow
Pick up where we left off, I don't wanna lose it, no

I used to wonder, like…
If I was singing songs just to sing the songs
Or if I was singing 'cause that's what the bitches wanted
I couldn't play guitar like Van Halen
Had no secret chords like Saint David
But you still came around, ate your lunch with me
Used to park your car to try the bus with me
But I would say, ""Girl, don't be dumb—
I'm riding shotgun""
We could go to my house after school
After school, after school
'Cause my dad don't clock off 'til late
Off 'til late, off 'til late
Looking through my whole vinyl collection
And you could teach me how to slow dance or something
And I'ma give you chills, harmonizing to
Otis,
Isley,
Marvin
And every time somebody ask me
If I sing songs to get at women
I say, ""Yeah,"" they say, ""No fair, no fair, it's cheating""
If I sing songs to get at women
I say, ""Yeah,"" they say, ""No fair, no fair, it's cheating""
I say, ""Boy, don't judge, 'cause, hell, if you were me…""
You'd be singin' to her
Like, ""La-da, da-da-da
La-da, da-da-da
La-da, da-da-da""
Now I'm in the lab, always working late
Always sleeping past the breakfast she makes
But she be banging that Drake in my car
I'm so far gone
She stay blasting Trey and his songs
Now, every time somebody ask me
If I sing songs to get my women
I say, ""Nah,"" they say, ""Okay, I don't believe it""
I say, ""Nope, I swear, I never do it""
And every time a nigga ask me
If I sing songs to get at women
I say, ""Nah,"" they say, ""Who do you think you kidding?
I know you, you stole my girlfriend""
Ah, ah (Ooh, ooh, ah)
Ooh, ah, yeah
Fair enough
You see, I just don't play fair
But it's fair enough
'Cause your girl broke my heart in half, uh-ah
I'm singing, ""La-da, da-da,"" 'bout heartbreak
And now, I'm singing, ""La-da, da-da,"" 'bout love lost
Damn, haha
I'm saying though, like…
All I write is love songs
And I try
I come to the studio
I—you know what I do
What you think I do it for? Huh?
Yeah, uh-huh
But you ain't listening, never
But if you were…
You might fuck wit' it
Haha, yeah

Born to hustle, I'm a product of environment
The game done changed, so I've been forced into retirement
But I make moves and I paid dues
First, implode and then explode, I am combustible
I ain't no killer, but don't push me
Goody-goody choir boy, never been no pussy
Could be carrying something up under my hoodie
Krizz would never snap and kill a baller, y'all, or would he?
Now, I wanna be peaceful, but I carry Desert Eagles where
Ever black people are, you know how black people are
I know y'all think less of me, 'cause I'm always sick and I can't let it be
I need depakote just to cope, that's why I keep throwing them pills down my throat
Or maybe I should pray for Jesus Christ to just un-pretzel me"

Dulce et Decorum Est,Wilfred Owen,1920,228807.0,https://genius.com/Wilfred-Owen-Dulce-et-Decorum-Est-lyrics,"Bent double, like old beggars under sacks,
Knock-kneed, coughing like hags,
we cursed through sludge,
Till on the haunting flares we turned our backs
And towards our distant rest began to trudge.
Men marched asleep. Many had lost their boots
But limped on, blood-shod. All went lame; all blind;
Drunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots
Of tired, outstripped Five-Nines that dropped behind.
Gas! GAS! Quick, boys! – An ecstasy of fumbling,
Fitting the clumsy helmets just in time;
But someone still was yelling out and stumbling,
And flound'ring like a man in fire or lime . . .
Dim, through the misty panes and thick green light,
As under a green sea, I saw him drowning.
In all my dreams, before my helpless sight,
He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning.
If in some smothering dreams you too could pace
Behind the wagon that we flung him in,
And watch the white eyes writhing in his face,
His hanging face, like a devil's sick of sin;
If you could hear, at every jolt, the blood
Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs,
Obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud
Of vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues, –
My friend, you would not tell with such high zest
To children ardent for some desperate glory,
The old Lie; Dulce et Decorum est
Pro patria mori."

Not about the money, those studs was mic-checkin' her
A few New York niggas had did her in the park
Pull out a chair for her, turn on the air for her
And just cool out, cool out, and listen to her
Sittin' on a bone, wishin' that I could do her
Eventually, if it was meant to be, then it would be
And she was fun then, I'd be geeked when she'd come around
Slim was fresh, yo, when she was underground
Original, pure, untampered, a down sister
Boy, I tell you, I miss her
A-yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
To the beat, y'all, and you don't stop
A-yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
A-one, two, y'all, and you don't stop
A-yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
Now, periodically, I would see
Ol' girl at the clubs, and at the house parties
She didn't have a body, but she started gettin' thick quick
Did a couple of videos, and became Afrocentric
Out goes the weave, in goes the braids, beads, medallions
She was on that tip about stoppin' the violence
So easily I approach
She dug my rap, that's how we got close
But then she broke to the West Coast, and that was cool
'Cause around the same time, I went away to school
And she did stud, she got big pub
So she got into R&B, hip-house, bass, and jazz
I wasn't salty she was with the
Boyz n the Hood
I thought it was dope how she was on that freestyle shit
Just havin' fun, not worried about anyone
And you could tell by how her titties hung
A-yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
To the beat, y'all, and you don't stop
A-yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
A-one, two, y'all, and you don't stop
A-yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
And to the beat, Com gotta be the sure shot
A-yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
Once The Man got to her, he altered her native
Told her if she got an image and a gimmick
That she could make money, and she did it like a dummy
Now I see her in commercials, she's universal
She used to only swing it with the inner-city circle
Now she be in the burbs, lookin' rock and dressin' hippie
Now she's a gangsta rollin' with gangsta bitches
Always smokin' blunts and gettin' drunk
Tellin' me sad stories, now she only fucks with the funk
Stressin' how hardcore and real she is
She was really the realest, before she got into showbiz
I did her, not just to say that I did it, but I'm committed
(Girl, he's committed) But so many niggas hit it
That she's just not the same, lettin' all these goofies do her
I see niggas slammin' her
and takin' her to the sewer
'Cause who I'm talkin' about, y'all, is hip-hop
To the beat, y'all, and you don't stop
A-yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
Mainframe, yo, they gotta be the sure shot
A-yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
To the beat, y'all, and you don't stop
A-yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop"

I felt a lot of pain but it didn't stop my heart
And all I really wanted was someone to give a little fuck
But I waited there forever and nobody even looked up
I tried it once before and I think I might've messed up
I struggled with the veins and I guess I didn't bleed enough
But maybe I'm alive 'cause I didn't really wanna die
But nothing very special ever happens in my life
Take the blade away from me
I am a freak, I am afraid that
All the blood escaping me won't end the pain
And I'll be haunting all the lives that cared for me
I died to be the white ghost
Of the man that I was meant to be
I tried it like before and this time I made a deep cut
I thought about my friends and the way I didn't give enough
And I should've told my mother, ""Mom, I love you,"" like a good son
But this life is overwhelming and I'm ready for the next one
Take the blade away from me
I am a freak, I am afraid that
All the blood escaping me won't end the pain
And I'll be haunting all the lives that cared for me
I died to be the white ghost
Of the man that I was meant to be, yeah
I tried it once again and I think I might black out
I should've left a letter but I had nothing to write about
My blood is all around me, I get dizzy if I stand up
The cutting part was easy but regretting it is so fucked
Yeah, take the blade away from me
I am a freak, I am afraid that
All the blood escaping me won't end the pain
And I'll be haunting all the lives that cared for me
I died to be the white ghost
Of the man that I was meant to be
I tried it once again and I think I went too far
I cut a little deeper and the pressure stopped my heart
I couldn't tell my mother that I love her, I'm a bad son
This life is overwhelming and I'm ready for the next one"

I go make 50 million then I give some millions to my people

They told me to tell you you mans are some wastemans
And stay in your place fam

For my teachers that said I wouldn't make it here
I spend a day what you make a year
I had to drop this to make it clear
That I got it locked like Jamaican hair
All theses choppers poppin', niggas wildin', violence
Why we even got to take it here?
Why we even got to play these games?
Run up on me, catch a facial there
It's the Chasers, what you thought?
I come through my block like I'm Rico
Poppin' a wheelie, no squealie, can't talk to the cops, that's illegal
I was like more a Rich Porter, no double-crossing on my peoples
I take an M to the table and split it with my niggas equal
I'm back on that hood shit, yeah that wish you would shit
I'm talking that cross you that fade you fourth quarter

Who promise fortune and fame, a life that's so carefree

Take the Power Back,Rage Against the Machine,1992,260534.0,https://genius.com/Rage-Against-the-Machine-Take-the-Power-Back-lyrics,"massive militant poetry
In the right light, study becomes insight
But the system that dissed us, teaches us to read
So-called facts are fraud
They want us to allege and pledge and bow down to their god
Lost the culture, the culture lost
Spun our minds and through time, ignorance has taken over
Yo, we gotta take the power back
Bam, here's the plan
Motherfuck Uncle Sam, step back, I know who I am
The
We need a movement with a quickness
You are the witness of change and to counteract
We gotta take the power back
Yeah, we gotta take the power back
Come on, come on
Yeah, we gotta take the power back
The present curriculum, I put my fist in 'em
Eurocentric, every last one of 'em
See right through the red, white, and blue disguise
With lecture I puncture the structure of lies
tears and fears
One-sided stories for years and years and years
Yeah, we need to check the interior
Of the system who cares about only one culture
Yeah, we gotta take the power back
Come on, come on
Yeah, we gotta take the power back
Ayo check, we're gonna have to break it
Break it, break it down, aw shit
The teacher stands in front of the class
But the lesson plan he can't recall
The student's eyes don't perceive the lies
Bouncing off every fucking wall
His composure is well kept
I guess he fears playing the fool
The complacent students sit
And listen to that bullshit that he'd learned in school
Europe ain't my rope to swing on
Can't learn a thing from it, yet we hang from it
(Gotta get it, gotta get it together then
Like the motherfuckin' Weathermen)
'Cause the circle of hatred continues unless we react
We gotta take the power back
Yeah, we gotta take the power back
Come on, come on
Yeah, we gotta take the power back
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies
No more lies

Cheated on your mom but she never left him
First I didn't get it, now I understand
He broke her heart, left money in her hands
She made sure you and your brother had way more
Than she ever had growing up
I could see it on your face, it was rough
Left a bad taste on your tongue
She would rain all day, couldn't wait for her

And you made it shine
There when she cried, you saved her life

And I regret I didn't tell you
Now I can't keep you from loving him
You made up your mind
Say I love you, girl, but I'm out of time
Say I'm there for you, but I'm out of time
Say that I'll care for you, but I'm out of time
Said I'm too late to make you mine, out of time (Ah)
If he mess up just a little
Baby, you know my line
If you don't trust him a little
Then come right back, girl, come right back
Give me one chance, just a little
Baby, I'll treat you right
And I'll love you like I shoulda loved you all the time
And I remember when I held you (Held you, baby)

Say that I'll care for you, but I'm out of time (Hey)
Said I'm too late to make you mine, out of time (Ah)
Don't you dare touch that dial
Because like the song says, you are out of time
Before you're completely engulfed in the blissful embrace of that little light you see in the distance
Soon you'll be healed, forgiven, and refreshed
Free from all trauma, pain, guilt, and shame
You may even forget your own name
But before you dwell in that house forever

Empty out another magazine like blah

ALLEN: Hey, Halberstram?
ALLEN: Why are there copies of the Style section all over the place? Do you... Do you have a dog? A little chow or something?
Is that a raincoat?
In '87, Huey released this;
Fore!
, their most accomplished album.
I think their undisputed masterpiece is ""Hip To Be Square""
A song so catchy, most people probably don't listen to the lyrics. But they should, because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity and the importance of trends. It's also a personal statement about the band itself.

For one moment, that it's too soon to forget
I know I can't afford to stop
For one moment, that it's too soon to forget
Ass so fat that you could see it from the front
Neck and wrist laced up, very little make-up
The Schwinns at the Reebok gym tone your frame up
Is sugar and spice the only thing that you made of?
I tried to play it low key, but couldn't keep it down
Asked her to dance and she was like, ""Yo, I'm leavin' now""
An hour later, sounds from Jamaica –
She's sippin' Cris' straight up, skankin', windin' her waist up
Scene 2 — my fam's throwin' a jam
Fareed is on the stand, big things is in the plans
The brother Big Mu makes space for me to move
""Aiyyo, this my man Mos, baby, let me introduce""
I turned around (""Say word!"")
Yo, it's the same pretty bird who I had priorly observed
Tryin' to play me for the herb
We conversated, made her laugh — yeah, you know me, bro
Even though I know the steelo, she wild sweet, yo
I know I can't afford to stop
For one moment, that it's too soon to forget
I know I can't afford to stop
For one moment, that it's too soon to forget
She blew my whole head with that, duke, I was like, ""Word?!""
I played it low though
I was like, ""Yeah, aight, come on then, let's go...""
Niggas was mad, niggas was so sick, I tell ya
They playin' Lovers Rock, I got the folded fingers on her waist
She walked away smilin', singing Gregory Isaacs
Like – ""
If I don't, if I don't have you...
""
Playin' Sade, ""Sweetest Taboo""
Man – I smashed it like a Idaho potato
Ginseng tree trunks, rockin' the P-funk
Cockin' her knees up, champion lover, not ease up
I got to have it
""
My shit is on Harrison Ford
Frantic
My ""911""'s unanswered by my fly Taurus enchantress
Next week, Mu hit me up, ""I saw Sharice at the Kitty Club
With some bangin' ass Asian, playin' 'lay it down and lick me up'""
""What?!!"""

Bl—Black Hippy shit, they be like, ""There he go!"" (Yeah)
Look up in the sky, it's a bird, it's a plane (Plane, yeah)

In my life and I never wanna leave
Don't be sorry if you know that I'm lonely
I don't feel like you know me well enough to understand
it's like you're stealing what I had for a while and using it yourself
In my mind, I see what I wanna see
And if it goes wrong, I think I'll never be the same, but I know it's only make believe
I'll pretend that you know me like you always wanted to
Maybe it stays as it's always been
Hazy and they see what we can't see
Please let me know if you want me around
And I'll try my hardest to be good
So don't be sorry if you know that I'm lonely
I don't feel like you know me well enough to understand
If you can show me that your thoughts are all holy
I'll pretend that you know me like you always wanted to"

Your Favorite Rap Song,Flatbush Zombies,2016,214497.0,https://genius.com/Flatbush-Zombies-Your-Favorite-Rap-Song-lyrics,"All I ever wanted was to be somebody
My reefer cloudy, lost to each assignment
Making beats and rhyming so proceed to find me
My speech align with ""teacher, teacher help me seek the knowledge""
But the street's is evil, we proceed to flee police and sirens
You fraudulent, I'm selling drugs
Where's the love? hit my plug
While the man is tryna cobra clutch us
Fancy nigga's stuck on a brand name
But any day it's O.E over champagne
I'm talking shit for my fan's sake
I give a fuck who can't relate
I'm arid landscape
I'm Kubrick with chemistry
You're degenerate, generously
Poor me, poor, poor me
I'm high as hell when indulging in these gorgeous women
Pave the future for boosters, I'm contributing my two cents
So I'm a nuisance
Producing and I tighten the loop, like it's a noose-sence
My crew is cool as the Fonz and you're Ferris Bueller
No time for your common coonery
Dreaming I been thugging like when Afeni conceived Pac
Flip O's a machine
Juicy like AI
break necks like Benoit
Remember me blessing you fools with my energy
My energy
Blessing you fools with my energy
Remember me blessing you fools with my energy
My energy
Blazing all these mics like show-time at Apollo
Gotta get the C.R.E.A.M
Money motivations, greens galore
New York we the greatest, these rap niggas hate us
Same drugs and same names
Been hot for 4 years
Pour another bottle fuck America's dreams
I was conceived under the rubble of the buildings
That Snoop crumbled back in 19-s-s-s-something
Inner Peace—Mind, Body, Soul; Holy Trinity
The Dark Man rides the pale horse
Down the road, the checker board
Kaleidoscope vision, my vision in vividest form
My prism is shimmering, glistening, I'm giving off
A ray of light, ironic 'cause my name comes from the dark
I am the spawn of the sin of my pops, yeah, I was taught
But I've evolved and got involved, my only flaw is that I know
My only flaw, and the earth revolves whether I am on it or nah
But fuck that, let's break the law
Gimme a 10, gimme a 9, fuck, just gimme a gatlin'
So I can crash the reunion and splatter his whole family
I ch-chew him and pew-pew him, I'm Duke Nukem
Pocket knife, clean slice, grab that M-O-P
I'm as cold as ice,
It's Fleezus Christ, I turn water to acid
My grandpa can't read or write
The cops never read my rights
Runnin' from them flashing lights like Ye when he was still with Nike
Devil's pie, the final slice, gave my life up to the mic
I channel ODB and Big and Pac before I sit and write
Acid tab and dirty sprite, I'm living the absurdest life
YSL Denim and Phillip Lim, my jeans virgin tight
Your favorite rapper bit my whole life, but he ain't serve it right
Come on dog, I got more bars than when your service right
One-ten in the stolen coupe, then I'm swervin' right
Y'all should call me Conrad Murray, the way I murder Mike

“Seriousness, you guys are the reason I listen to music, in hip hop in general, especially”
“You guys are my fuckin' heroes! King’s County baby!”
“Flatbush Zombies new album recorded, gonna be lit
Meechy Darko: lit

And Zombie Juice: lit.”
“Ughhhh, so fuckin' zooted right now, ohhhhh myyyy godddddd”
“How in the fuck are we supposed to be doin' this?
How you gonna tell me an hour of my life is only worth $11 an hour?!
I’m out here tryin' to get behind doin' what I gotta do. I’m shit
An hour of my life ain’t worth anything
And that is why Flatbush is what it is
‘Cause they do what the fuck they want, when they want
Makin’ music, follow your dreams, inspire a king! Thank you!”"

The bigger question is how the Russians did it
It was written like Nas, but it came from Quentin
At the mercy of a game where the codes is missin'
When the CEO's blinded by the glow it's different
Believe in myself and the Coles and Kendricks
Let the sock puppets play in their roles and gimmicks
Shit, remember Will Smith won the first Grammy?
And they ain't even recognize Hov until ""Annie""
So I don't tap dance for the crackers and sing Mammy

Niggas looked at me crazy like I really killed a baby
Salute Ross 'cause the message was pure
He see what I see when you see Wayne on tour
Flash without the fire
Another multi-platinum rapper trapped and can't retire
Niggas get exposed, I see the cracks and I’m the liar?
Shit, I've been exposed, I took the crack and built the wire

I be on the chemicals, she be on my testicles
Poke her with my tentacle then put her out my schedules
Rolling up them vegetables

Beamin' up the motor, Scotty
Talking to promoters, Scotty
Everybody know it's Gotti

The rev undid, the all day madness
Got it off the wipe it off, the evidence, the blood on mattress

You gon' keep talkin' or are we lockin' it up?
And I'm the type of nigga it ain't never been an honor to judge
You a mouse that the falcon picked up
So disrespect will get you checked like the top of the month
I was a liar as a kid so now I'm honest as fuck
And I never pass my mama no blunt
And kept my head straight
Listen deadweight never been a problem to dunk
Look, I just broke up with my bitch cause we ain't argue enough
I keep it dirty as a spliff my uncle Alchemist puff
I strike a birdie on 'em, while I hit your mouth with the club
I wake up early on 'em, gettin' out the house is a must
It's like a sweaty pit, sweaty sick, countin' your dubs
Either that or you gon' catch me on a mountain with monks
Loungin',

The soil falling over my head
And as I climb into an empty bed
Oh well, enough said
I know it's over, still I cling
I don't know where else I can go
Over
Oh, Mother, I can feel
The soil falling over my head
See, the sea wants to take me, the knife wants to slit me
Do you think you can help me?
Sad veiled bride, please be happy
Handsome groom, give her room
Loud, loutish lover, treat her kindly
Though she needs you more than she loves you
And I know it's over, still I cling
I don't know where else I can go
Over and over and over and over, over and over
I know it's over, and it never really began
But in my heart it was so real
And you even spoke to me, and said
""If you're so funny
Then why are you on your own tonight?
And if you're so clever
Then why are you on your own tonight?
If you're so very entertaining
Then why are you on your own tonight?
If you're so very good-looking
Why do you sleep alone tonight?
I know, 'cause tonight is just like any other night
That's why you're on your own tonight
With your triumphs and your charms
While they're in each other's arms""
It's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate
It takes strength to be gentle and kind
Over, over, over, over
It's so easy to laugh, it's so easy to hate
It takes guts to be gentle and kind
Over, over
Love is natural and real
But not for you, my love
Not tonight, my love
Love is natural and real
But not for such as you and I
My love

The soil falling over my head, oh
Mother, I can feel
The soil falling over my head, oh

Do you really love me, do you really trust me?
I was down bad, feelin' sad, feelin' sorry
Now you really gone, and I can't get you to call me

Campaign Speech,Eminem,2016,807005.0,https://genius.com/Eminem-Campaign-Speech-lyrics,"Jumped out of the 2nd floor of a record store
With a Treacherous Four cassette and a cassette recorder
In Ecuador with Edward Norton
Witness the metamorphosis
Of a legend growin' like an expert swordsman
From the Hessian war and
Hence the origin of the Headless Horseman
Born with the endorphins of a pathetic orphan
Endless source and reservoir
Of extension cords in dresser drawers
And deadbolts on the bedroom doors
And sexual torture kits kept in a separate storage bin
Excellent boyfriend
Use intercourse to settle scores
With women who have vendettas towards men
Dickhead is forced in 'til there's shredded foreskin
Reddish torn and they're only bein' fed a portion
Bed sores and sore shins
Pregnant whores can get abortions
Fetish for stickin' metal forks in, self-absorption
Skeletor, I went to Hell and fell a floor
A predator, I'm headed for competitors
Better warn 'em, what I lack in tact and a set of morals
I make up for in metaphors like a cosmetic store
Stegosaurus, Chuck Norris with a thesaurus
Yes, of course, a mess of warrants
You want some? Come and get some, boys!
I'm givin' Daniel Pantaleo a refresher course
On excessive force and pressure points
And dressin' George Zimmerman in a fluorescent orange
Dress and four inch heels to address the court
With a bullseye on his back, his whole chest and torso
Are left on the doorsteps of Trayvon's dad as a present for him
In my present form I'm Desert Storm
Appetite for destruction there's no suppressant for
Aggressive, forceful, and less remorseful in every morsel
Unpleasant, horrible; hello, gorgeous!
The rebel with devil horns just fell off the yellow short bus
Met a contortionist, said, ""When you wanna get sexual?""
She said, ""However I fit in your schedule. I'm flexible.""
Expired tags on the Saturn, got Catherine Bach
In the back in Daisy Dukes with the hazards on
At a traffic stop gettin' harassed, sign an autograph
For this asshole cop's daughter
Laugh 'cause I called her a brat on it
He spat on it and brought it back lookin' half in shock
Had a heart attack and dropped dead
Started fallin' back with it
And got slapped with a Colin Kaepernick practice sock
One ball and half a dick, Apple Watch
Crack front axle, walked in a Bass Pro Shop with David Hasselhoff,
pulled Tabasco sauce out of my satchel
Knocked over a fisherman's tackle box and *crash sound*
Asked if they had a laugh in stock
That was fuckin' stupid…
You got it twisted, all 'cause I offered this bitch
A doggie biscuit, you call me misogynistic
Bitch, get to massagin' this dick!
Like spas in this bitch, slob on it with gobs of lipstick
Got a shoppin' list for you to run some odds and ends with
There's not a bitch on this earth I can be monogamous with
She's non-existent
Robin Thicke with a throbbin' dick on some suave and slick shit
But I shout derogatives at bitches like fuckin' missile launches
Misfit, blond and nitwit
Like I've gone ballistic, with a frostin' tip kit
Screamed, ""I hate blondes,"" and became one, I'm optimistic
Love to start shit
Shovin' Clark Kent's undergarments in the glove compartment
Of the bucket, bumpin' Bubba Sparxxx
I'm double parkin' up at Targets, trouble causer, a double crosser
Shadiest mothafucka you'll ever come across
Olympic gymnast, been known for some assaults
A couple lawsuits, enough to cause a stomach ulcer
Same damn brain scan results as Rainman's is
Something's off, but when Dustin Hoffman's
Dressin' up in your mummy costume
On stage dancin' to ""Brain Damage,"" what's the problem?
Nothing's wrong, the name brand is back to reclaim status
Run the faucet, I'ma dunk
A bunch of Trump supporters underwater
Snuck up on 'em in Ray-Bans in a gray van with a spray tan
It's a wrap, like an ACE bandage
Don't-give-a-fuck persona, to my last DNA strand
E&J in the waistband, at the VMAs with the stagehand
She wants kielbasa, pre-arrange an escape plan
Three-inch blade on point, like a See-and-Say
Consider me a dangerous man
But you should be afraid of this dang candidate
You say Trump don't kiss ass like a puppet
'Cause he runs his campaign with his own cash for the fundin'
And that's what you wanted
A fuckin' loose cannon who's blunt with his hand on the button
Who doesn't have to answer to no one—great idea!
If I was president, gettin' off is
The first order of business, once I get in office
Second thing that'll make me happy's walkin' up to Uncle Sam
Naked, laughin', dick cupped in hand
Screamin', ""Fuck safe sex!""
Throw a latex and an AIDS test at him
Tell Congress I run this land
And I want the rubber banned, and make it snappy
Addiction to friction and static
Addict who can't escape the habit
Continue to chase the dragon
But as fate would have it, I walked up in Major Magics
Dressed as the maintenance man
In a laser tag vest and a racin' jacket
With a gauge to blast it
And sped away in the station wagon
Stacey Dash's and Casey Anthony's
Crazy asses in the backseat
Throwin' Stayfree pads at me
Dead passenger in the passenger seat
Unfasten the safety latches
And slam on the brakes in traffic so hard
I snapped the relocation brackets for the monster tires
'Finna get a murder case and catch it
Like you threw it at me encased in plastic
And send Dylann Roof through the windshield of the Benz
Until he spins like a pinwheel and begins feelin'...
Like a windmiller with a thin build while his skin's peelin'
And skids 'til he hits a cement pillar
Swing for the fence like Prince Fielder
Knock it into the upper peninsula
You wanna go against 'zilla? The Rap God
When will I quit? Never been realer
The in-stiller of fear, not even a scintilla of doubt
Whose pen's iller than Prince in a chinchilla
Or Ben Stiller in a suspense thriller
Revenge killer, avenge syllable binge
Fill a syringe, 'til I
Draw first blood
Even pop shit on my pop shit, and it's popular
Couldn't be more awkwarder
'Cause your innocence I robbed you of
It's my fingers that got stuck up
Taught ya ta not give a
Slapstick, hockey puck
The broad hunter with the sawed off
Like an arm when it's lopped off of ya
But I'm not gonna get the shotgun
Or Glock, I'ma opt for the ox
Cause I'm into objects that are sharp when I shop
And it's not a shock, I'm such an obnoxious fucker
The Rock Hudson of rock 'cause who would have thought
This much of a cocksucker to go across the buttocks of Vivica Fox with a box cutter
That was for 50, little slap on the wrist be warned
I'm unravelin' quickly
My squabbles, I'm grappling with your time traveling with me
Try and follow, as I wobble, relapse into history, with a flask of the whiskey
Tip it back then I'm twisting wine bottles
Like what happened to Chris Reeve's spine column
That's the plan of attack when I'm fixing my problems
Wish my chest wasn't having to get these rhymes off 'em
But the fact that I have so many rappers against me mind boggles
And why I haven't come back on these faggots who diss me is
More of a spectacular mystery than a fucking Agatha Christie crime novel
But my patience is wearing thin
Swear I been contemplatin' rubbing shit in your face 'til I smear it in
Diss you in every lyric until you fear the pen
And never appear again
If you actually had fuckin' careers to end
But then I think of Molly Qerim and I steer 'em in that direction and forget my ideas for them
Molly, I'm gone off you
Man, light some kush
You're my first take, I'll nail you
Can't lie, I gush
If I won you over, you would be the grand prize
I'm entranced by your looks, come and give the Shady franchise a push
You can get it in the can like some Anheuser-Busch
Jeans too small, least three pant sizes tush
Mushed against your damn side, your puss
And thighs are squished
What kind of attire's that?
I'm ready to be rode
Psychopath, bet you we'll get it poppin' like a flat
Light the match to ignite the wrath
Got knives to slash and slice hermaphrodites in halves
Piper Chapmans might just have to picket me
Like a scab
Hard to describe in fact
Startling violent perhaps
Are things that come to mind as soon as I start spitting rhymes like that
And you aren't really surprised at that
But as far as these lines I rap
And these bars, wouldn't dial it back if I star 69ed the track
Why am I such a dick?"
Homecoming,Kanye West,2007,1365281.0,https://genius.com/Kanye-West-Homecoming-lyrics,"And you say Chi city!
Chi city! Chi city!
I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
(Yeah)
I met this girl when I was three years old
And what I loved most, she had so much soul
She said, ""Excuse me, little homie, I know you don't know me, but
My name is Windy and I like to blow trees,"" and
From that point, I'd never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to tow 'em off
And make 'em straighten up they hat 'cause she know they soft
And when I grew up, she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime, her face lit up, so astoundin'
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never messed with entertainers 'cause they always leave
She said, ""It felt like they walked and drove on me""
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said, ""Ye, keep makin' that, keep makin' that platinum and gold for me""
I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm comin' home again
-Min' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then? Oh!
Now I'm comin' home again
But if you really cared for her
Then you wouldn't've never hit the airport to follow your dreams
Sometimes, I still talk to her
But when I talk to her, it always seems like she talkin' 'bout me
She said, ""You left your kids, and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you,"" and I just got through
Talkin' 'bout what niggas tryin' to do just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that? When I was back home
Reach for the stars, so if you fall, you land on a cloud
Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around
If you don't know by now, I'm talkin' 'bout Chi-Town
Baby, do you remember when
Fireworks at Lake Michigan? Oh!
Now I'm comin' home again
-Min' home again
Baby, do you remember when
Fireworks at Lake Michigan? Oh!
Now I'm comin' home again
Maybe we can start again"

And she look cute
But that mean shit to me, I crept up then I boomed
There go that Porsche

Got a text from Herb
I say, ""Shit, I'm just coolin', bitch

Ayo, Bo knows this (

But Bo don't know jack, 'cause Bo can't rap
Well, what do you know? The Di-Dawg is first up to bat
No batteries included, and no strings attached
No holds barred, no time for move-fakin'
Gots to get the loot, so I can bring home the bacon
Brothers front, they say, ""The Tribe can't flow""
But we've been known to do the impossible like Broadway Joe, so
Sleep if you want, Nytol will help you get your Z's, troop
But here's the real scoop
I'm all that and then some, short, dark, and handsome
Bust a nut inside your eye to show you where I come from
I'm vexed, fumin', I've had it up to here
My days of payin' dues are over, acknowledge me as in there (

Keep your battery charged, you know it won't stick, yo

Should've let your trick ho chick hold your sick glow
Plus nobody couldn't do nothin' once he let the brick go
And you know I know that's a bunch of snow
The beat is so butter, peep the slow cutter
As he utter the calm flow (""Your mother—""), don't talk about my moms, yo
Sometimes he rhyme quick, sometimes he rhyme slow
Or vice versa, whip up a slice of nice verse pie
Hit it on the first try, villain: the worst guy
Spot hot tracks like spot a pair of fat asses
Shots of the scotch from out the square shot glasses
And he won't stop 'til he got the masses
And show 'em what they know not through flows of hot molasses
Do it like the robot to headspin to boogaloo
Took a few minutes to convince the average bug-a-boo
It's ugly, like look at you, it's a damn shame
Just remember ALL CAPS when you spell the man name
And you know it like a poet, like baby doll
I bet she tried to say she gave me her all, she played ball
All bets off! The Villain got the dice rigged
And they say he accosted the man with the sliced wig
Allegedly; the investigation is still ongoing
In this pesky nation he gots the best con flowin'

(Psst, hahaha, over here)
Looking at me, so I ask
You’re crazy! I like you, but you’re crazy
Never that, my mind's for sure shady
Pure Hades,
Rev X said that he couldn’t endure to save me
Why do I let this stripper burn me on my arm with a cigarette in the same spot ten times in a row?
When I felt that burn,
Maybe she never let a fine nigga stare at her breasts
Strange Lane
I like fire on my skin, blood on my draws
From up on her walls, I’m sufferin', I’m stuck in her claws
Stuffed in her jaws, huffin' and puffin', hollerin', I'm a dog
Afterwards I like really hot scaldin' water on my balls
Heck, if I was sane I would've put down the mic
And said, ""Fuck it, I'll never rise to fame.""
But with the wicked wreckage I contain
I could probably jeopardize your name
Sorry, that ain't very merry to say
Why is this game so scary to play?
Pause a minute, I'm stressin' again
If I go to Hell, then Heaven's to blame
I don’t mean to come off crazy
But you mothafuckas seem to think I’m hella deranged
When I was seven years old
I fell on my head and I severed my brain
You think I’m lyin'? Then ask my mama
Nigga, she'll go tell you the same—
Should I be ashamed? No
I’m livin' my life so ghetto fabulous
I stab you with this mic, and rap this verse I'm rappin' to you
I am not no fuckin' jacket with no matchin' shoes
And you are not no fashion guru
Matter of fact, act like I'm rappin' to you
If that gives you passion to use this as an excuse
Then just jump up out of conclusion
That I'm attackin' you dudes; it's just like old-fashion voodoo
Babysittin'
little bastards
You can call me psychotic, but it’s more like schizophrenic
And I can't sleep, can anyone tell me
Just where my medicine is?
Guess I gotta show these minors just what my avenue is
Damn it, Bobby boy! What in the hell?
What in the heaven? What in the Earth?"

They said the best classes go to the fastest, sorry, Mr. West
There's no good classes, and that's what yo' ass get
Not even electives? Not even prerequisites?
You mean I missed my major by a couple of seconds?
Now I'm in the shop class or the basket weavin'
With all the rest of the motherfuckers underachievin'
Man, this is an insult
I went to junior high with all of them and they been slow
If I can catch the beat then slow down the tempo
Just throw this at the end if I'm too late for the intro
Will I make it from the student loans to a Benzo?
Like old folks pissin', I guess it all depends, oh, oh

Try and make it to the party 'fore the guest list close
With the freshest hoes, the professors know
We about to get real unprofessional
like them Eskimos
What would you do for a Klondike?
Or two dykes that look Christina Milian-like?
Hmm, I'll be on time for that
I ain't thought of no line that could rhyme with that
Yo, I'll be there in five minutes
Five hours later? ""I'll be there in five minutes,""
Been bullshittin' but I finally arrived with it
I know it's late and I took all year but

The beach is a good place to pick up girls
Because you can really see what you're getting
Most beaches are— of chicks
And they’re— and they're— and they're— and they’re— and they're
And they're— and they're— and they're
I've been moving in backward directions
During astral projections
I plaster my ass on the wall for attention
I need faster connections
Past is regret, eye flash from the gemses
If I didn't care what my friends did
Friends that pretend, wanna end when you get bit
Ends with a sniff or a huff or injection
I can't handle rejection
Stand my reflection, damn, no one gets it
Should I be kind or remind that I’m weak?
So I fall more behind every week
I’m the 'shine when the guys take a peek
I cry from my eyes to my feet
Stairs to the streets, to the gutters, to the sea
When I mutter in my sleep
I say, ""Mother never weep,"" my brother finds blood
I say, ""Shut up ’fore she sees,"" another motherfuckin' trap
Won-wonder will she weep, won-wonder where she be
Thunder on my teeth, spittin' natural disasters
God told me, ""Cat, don't mess with the past tense
You’re testin' the masters""
So guess what the fact is? My ex is a bachelor
this Hennessy is cursed
Someone hexed all the bottles (
Someone
 hexed all the bottles
)
I swear on my life, I always try
But in my eyes, I can fly
Sigh
Better luck next time
Bet-bet-better luck next time
Better luck next time
Bet-bet-bet-bet-better luck next time
Better luck next time
Bet-bet-bet-bet-better luck next time
Better luck next time
Bet-bet-bet-bet-better luck next time
Better luck next time"

Turn the corners in a foreign car
Call the coroners, do the CPR

Her bittersweet taste made his gold teeth ache, uh
Make her knees shake, make a priest faint, uh
Make a nun cum, make her cremate, uh
Move downtown, cop a sweet space, uh
Livin' life like we won the sweepstakes, what?
We headed to hell for Heaven's sakes, huh
Well, I'ma levitate, make the devil wait, yeah

Have you lost your mind?
Tell me when you think we crossed the line
No more drugs for me, pussy and religion is all I need
Grab my hand and baby, we'll live a hell of a life
Never in your wildest dreams
Never in your wildest dreams, in your wildest
You could hear the loudest screams
Comin' from inside the screen, you a wild bitch
Tell me what I gotta do to be that guy
Said her price go down, she ever fuck a black guy
Or do anal, or do a gangbang
It's kinda crazy that's all considered the same thing
Well, I guess a lotta niggas do gangbang
And if we run trains, we all in the same gang
Runaway slaves
all on a chain gang
Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang

We'll have a big-ass crib and a long yard
We'll have a mansion and some fly maids
Nothin' to hide, we both screwed the bridesmaids
She wanna roleplay 'til I roll over
I'ma need a whole day, at least roll doja
What party is we goin' to on Oscar day?
'specially if she can't get that dress from Oscar de
La Renta, they wouldn't rent her, they couldn't take the shame
Snatched the dress off her back and told her, ""Get away""
How could you say they live they life wrong?
When you never fuck with the lights on

Have you lost your mind?
Tell me when you think we crossed the line
No more drugs for me, pussy and religion is all I need
Grab my hand and baby, we'll live a hell of a life

And got married in the bathroom

Is There More,Drake,2018,584186.0,https://genius.com/Drake-Is-There-More-lyrics,"Only problems I do are math problems with profit
Only cryin' I do is cryin' from laughin' 'bout it
Only lackin' I can do is my lack of responses
Only rest that I do is, ""Where the rest of my commas?""
Still I rise, Maya Angelou vibes
When life comin' at you from all angles and sides
Love certain ones but never get attached to 'em
Give 'em nice things, but what's that to 'em?
Especially when another girl I flew in is flickin' up in my bathroom
And they recognize the bathroom
I would rather lose my leg than lose they respect
I'm in control of my destiny, never in doubt
Houston women I wine-and-dine and take to the house
My moral compass is janky, it breaks in the South
Sweeter the berry, the blacker the juice
Too many Walt Disney characters, mouses and goofs
I mean, you know I love a challenge, but challenged by who?
My peers are a talented group
But even if you take all they statistics and carry the two
Even if you rounded up the numbers and rounded the troops
There's still nothin' they could really do
It's too bad reality checks don't cover the balances due
Yeah, soon as this album drop I'm out of the deal
In the house playin' D'Angelo, ""How Does It Feel?""
Is there more to life than goin' on trips to Dubai?
Passion, instant
Sweat beads, feel me (Feel me)
Cupid's shot me
My heartbeat's racing (My heartbeat's racing)
Tempt me, drive me (Tempt me)
It feels so exciting
Thought of highly (Highly)

More than a woman

Did a ton of drugs and did better than all my Alma mater
Motherfucker money dance, hundreds xan, gallon lean
Make a joke 'bout Leno's hair then piggyback on Fallon's spleen
Balancing on sporadicity and fucking pure joy
Nightly searches for a bed and I just came off tour with Troy
But I can't complain, I got some motherfucking bitches
How many lab partners have I fucked since I got suspended?

Kicking dirt on the shirts of the lames
Keep a tab on my exes, keep some X on my tongue
Keep my work out in Texas, that's just me flexin' my lungs
See them showin' they teeth, that's just them flappin' they gums
If they bite and I'm snappin', clap clap, collapsing they lungs
Call me Chancelor The Rapper, please say, ""The Rapper""
Magical word (Poof), please say ""Kadabra""

Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
And darlin', I will be lovin' you till we're seventy
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
And I'm thinkin' 'bout how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, me, I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am
So honey, now, take me into your lovin' arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
And place your head on my beatin' heart, I'm thinkin' out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mmm
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
I'm thinkin' 'bout how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe it's all part of a plan
Oh, I'll just keep on makin' the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand
That, baby, now, take me into your lovin' arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beatin' heart, I'm thinkin' out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are, oh-oh
So baby, now, take me into your lovin' arms
And kiss me under the light of a thousand stars, oh, darlin'
Place your head on my beatin' heart, I'm thinkin' out loud

Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
But loving him was red
(Red, red)
(Red, red)
Loving him was red
(Red, red)
(Red, red)
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Whoa)
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
But loving him was red
(Red, red)
Oh, red (Red, red)
Burning red (Red, red)

Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Burning, it was red
Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Whoa)
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
'Cause loving him was red

But it's left me so undone (Shake him off)
And I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't
So here's to drinks in the dark at the end of my rope
And I'm ready to suffer and I'm ready to hope
It's a shot in the dark aimed right at my throat

Scuffle a couple of rounds 'til we hear the thunder sound
No lightnin',

And after the violence, a moment of silence
'Cause I want mine the fast way
The ski mask way, lookin' for a fast pay
And instead of stickin' up for each other
We pickin' up guns and stickin' up our brothers
And I won't stop 'til Reagan is caged in

And the doors are slowly closin' while we fallin' through the cracks of it

Yeah, long live the idols, may they never be your rivals

Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin
I used to print out Nas raps and tape 'em up on my wall
My niggas thought they was words, but it was pictures I saw
And since I wanted to draw, I used to read 'em in awe
Then he dropped
Stillmatic
, rocked the cleanest velour
Fast forward, who'da thought that I would meet him on tour
I'm earnin' stripes now, a nigga got Adidas galore
Backstage I shook his hand, let 'em know that he's the man
When he said he was a fan it was too hard to understand
No time to soak up the moment though ‘cause I was in a jam
Hov askin' where's the record that the radio could play and
I was strikin' out for months, 9th inning, feelin' fear
Jeter under pressure, made the biggest hit of my career
But at first, that wasn't clear, niggas had no idea
Dion called me when it dropped, soundin' sad but sincere
Told me Nas heard your single and he hate that shit
Said, ""You the one, yo, why you make that shit?""

I couldn't help but think that maybe I had made a mistake
I mean, you made ""You Owe Me"", dog, I thought that you could relate
But while I shot up the charts
You mean tellin' me that I was not up to par when I followed my heart?
Granted, my heart was tainted by my mind that kept on sayin', ""Where's the hits? You ain't got none
You know Jay'll never put your album out without none,""
And, dog, you know how come
Labels are archaic, formulaic with they outcomes, huh
They don't know, they just study the charts
Me, I studied the shows, the fans, studied they hearts
I had a feelin' I was killin', and this music we were spillin' out
Would change lives forever, fuck the label, put it out
Friday Night Lights
 blew, that was classic number two
Now it seemed as if the Nas comparisons was comin' true
Still no release date from the label, are they insane?
Gucc told me play the game to change the game
[Chorus: J. Cole]
But on the way I let Nas down
Damn, I got no one to blame
I'm ashamed, I let Nas down
But this is God's plan, you could never understand, fuck it
Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you're 'bout to hear is a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin
I always believed in the bigger picture
If I could get them niggas to listen outside my core then I can open the door
Reintroduce 'em to honesty, show 'em that they need more
The difference between the pretenders and the Kendrick Lamars
And so, I took the fall
Like the son of the Lord on the cross dyin' for that fake shit you niggas bought
For the past decade
If I should pass, please let this be my last essay
Therefore I write from the heart
Apologies to OGs for sacrificin' my art
But I'm here for a greater purpose, I knew right from the start
I'm just a man of the people, not above but equal
And for the greater good I walk amongst the evil
Don't cry, Mama, this the life I choose myself
Just pray along the way that I don't lose myself
This is for the nigga that said that Hip-Hop was dead
I went to Hell to resurrect it, how could you fail to respect it?
Letting Nas down
I got the phone call
Quietly I mourned, dog, I let Nas down
Yeah, and on this flight
May I never lose sight, fuck it
Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you just heard's a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin, begin
Story begin"

Sideline Story,J. Cole,2011,579731.0,https://genius.com/J-Cole-Sideline-Story-lyrics,"Tired of comin' up short—fuck abbreviated
Want my whole name spelt out, my own pain spilt out
No pain, no gain, I blow brains—Cobain
Throw flames, Liu Kang,
the coach ain't help out, so I call my own shots
I'm David Blaine, I'm breakin' out of my own box, you stay the same
But homie if you change, may you change for the better
Still loved him just enough to put up with the cheatin'
Months go by and only see him for a weekend
I say a prayer—hope my girl ain't leavin'
Money come fast so bein' hungry don't last
'Til you look in the mirror and you saw who you was
My reign gonna last like 3-4 eras
Say hello to the real, I can be your hero
Hey, I'ma put us all on the map
Gone and I ain't lookin' back
I know they gone feel it like they tank on E
I wish somebody made guidelines
On how to get up off the sidelines
Up in first class, laugh even though it's not funny
See a white man wonder how the fuck I got money
While he sit at coach, hate to see me walk past
Young black pants sag, headphones blastin'
Know what he askin', ""How did he manage?""
""With all the cards against him, he used them to his advantage!""
Slang we be speakin' probably soundin' like Spanish
Then I fuck they heads up when a nigga show manners
Some New York niggas thought it was funny callin' us 'Bama
Laughin' at the grammar cause they didn't understand us
Must've thought we slow, but little do they know
I came up here to take advantage of that shit y'all take for granted
Opportunity, that I would kill for
Lookin' at rappers like ""What the fuck you got a deal for?!""
When I was assed out with my funds low
It's nice to know I had the whole world at my front door
Hey, I'ma put us all on the map
Gone and I ain't lookin' back
I know they gone feel it like they tank on E
I wish somebody made guidelines
On how to get up off the sidelines
I made it to the rock, even though they tried to box me out
I got the key to the game, they tried to lock me out
But what they don’t understand is this is all planned
It’s a bigger picture and you can’t photoshop me out
Some nigga ask me why Jay never shout me out
Like I’m supposed to give a fuck
Don’t you know that I be out in France
Where the fans throw they hands like Pacquiao
Not cause my looks, cause my hooks could knock Rocky out
Young Simba been a lion from the start
My life like a movie, truly
And these niggas is dyin' for the part
But, you’ll never play me like LeBron vs. Jordan
Twenty years, wonder who they gone say was more important
Both changed the game, came through and made a lane
Who’s to say that who’s greater, all we know, they ain’t the same
Hey, I'ma put us all on the map
Gone and I ain't lookin' back
I know they gone feel it like they tank on E
I wish somebody made guidelines
On how to get up off the sidelines"

Both in a trance, feelings are dead—what a fast life
Manager called, the lobby call is 11:30
Room full of clothes, bag full of money: call it loose change
Fumbled my jewelry, 100K, I lost a new chain
Hop on the bird, hit the next city for another M
Take me a nap, then do it again
We all woke up, tryna tune to the daily news
Looking for confirmation, hoping election wasn't true
All of us worried, all of us buried, in our feelings deep
None of us married to his proposal, make us feel cheap
Stale and sad, distraught and mad, tell the neighbor 'bout it—
Bet they agree, parade the streets with your voice proudly
Time passing, things change
Reverting back to our daily programs, stuck in our ways
Lust
Lately, I feel like I been lusting over the fame
Lately, we lust on the same routine of shame
Lately (Lately) Lately, my lust been heightened (Lately)
Lately, it's all contradiction (Lately, I'm not here)
Lately, I lust over self (Lust turn into fear)
Lately, in James 4:4 says
""Friend of the world is enemy of the Lord""
Brace yourself: Lust is all yours

My sister just asked for a Lexus
What's  the point of havin' a best friend if you end up losin' him?
Fourth grade, Mary J. Blige all I like
I made a mill' off a lie and a lie so I write another lie
RCA‚ that note wasn't 'bout y'all
No lies‚ it was about how me and my brothers been traumatized
And I must keep creatin' truths and hooks to get up outta this hell for myself
Seashells
Dearly departed
Look what you've started
I've been so heartless
I try‚ I try, I try
Rest in peace Wako, Ray, Rita
Wish you could've took me to Japan
Bloody colored trinkets wrapped around my wrist
They stretch the truth longer than the Nile
Eyes full of evil, mouth full of vile
Stay alert, big dog
Only one life is offered to you
(Only one life is offered to you)
I got all my thoughts out on records y'all won't ever hear
Tried to give it time
When somebody that you know throws you in the fire
How do you survive?
I kicked down the door inside a home I didn't own just to save a friend's life
Little did I know, the one who pulled the strings was once on my side
I had just moved to Texas, tried to make it right
I do not feel obliged to dismiss the truth because of how I feel about our time
Pass the weight off to your friends and never face the truth
Because you never learned how to be a man
You could talk to God
I don't wanna hear, motherfucker"

But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
And I can picture it after all these days
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
And you were tossing me the car keys, ""Fuck the patriarchy""
Key chain on the ground, we were always skipping town
He's gonna say it's love, you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearing it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new Hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Some actress asking me what happened, you
Sipping coffee like you're on a late-night show
And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
And I was never good at telling jokes, but the punch line goes
""I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age""
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it all too well"
Brendas Got a Baby,2Pac,1991,429021.0,https://genius.com/2Pac-Brendas-Got-a-Baby-lyrics,"I hear Brenda's got a baby, but Brenda's barely got a brain
A damn shame, the girl can hardly spell her name
""That's not our problem, that's up to Brenda's family""
It's sad, 'cause I bet Brenda doesn't even know
Just 'cause you're in the ghetto doesn't mean you can't grow
Do whatever it takes to resist the temptation
Brenda got herself a boyfriend
Her boyfriend was her cousin, now let's watch the joy end
She tried to hide her pregnancy, from her family
Who really didn't care to see, or give a damn if she
Went out and had a church of kids
As long as when the check came, they got first dibs
Now Brenda's belly's gettin' bigger
But no one seems to notice any change in her figure
She's twelve years old and she's havin' a baby
In love with a molester, who's sexin' her crazy
And yet and all she thinks that he'll be with her forever
And dreams of a world where the two of them are together
She had it on the bathroom floor and didn't know, so
I guess she thought she'd get away, wouldn't hear the cries
She didn't realize how much the little baby had her eyes
Now the baby's in the trash heap, bawlin'
Mama can't help her, but it hurts to hear her callin'
So now, what's next? It ain't nothin' left to sell
So she sees sex as a way of leavin' hell
It's payin' the rent, so she really can't complain"

better not forget that spit it like I chain smoke Newports
Just before you forgot about him, overlooked or started doubting
I doused it with the flow and started talking all this water shit
It's like I started drowning
In  truth,
the thought is pounding
I started counting the loopholes in they stories that they tell us
Every evening at like 10 when Judy Hsu is on yo TV tellin'
Songs in the key of life, you was on yo Stevie
Why you reaching? I'm like 6'5""
Stop it
I'd  never run from a battle I'd rather hang from the gallows
For I let a stray bullet catch a nigga on the 9
It's a shame that's the game on these young niggas minds like
Hanging on for dear life
For the love of the money
Hanging on for dear life
Don't that shit sound funny?
Hanging on for dear life
For the love of the gold
Hanging on for dear life
Don't that shit feel cold?"

And ooh, girl, I wanna embrace you
Domesticate you
But you belong to the world
And I know that I'm saying too much
Even though I'd rather hold my tongue, yeah
And I'll pull you closer holding on to
Every moment 'til my time is done, yeah
And this ain't right, you've been the only one to make me smile
In so long, I've succumbed to what I've become, oh, baby

Will I see you through my hazeus view?
Will I see you through my hazeus, my hazeus, my hazeus
My hazeus, my hazeus view?
You ain't running with the apes yet, apex at the Empire State neck
Hand no crown, my niggas take that
In this state of mind, gotta state facts, suspect nigga
Get your wig pushed back tonight, to 1999
Who'd've thought that 19 I might be in my prime?
Thought of the right scheme, everything else align
Here's a penny for your thoughts, another one, another one
Eventually the dream was bought
Might fuck up your mind if you're lighting up
Make sure the ting is tight enough
If you tough
I'm a titan, like Zeus I enlighten them
Kick flows 'til it's kung-fu fighting them
Is it him, it is you who was nice as him?
I don't see nobody, no, no
I don't see nobody, no, no

I keep the bombs in my basement
When I detonate, you can feel the vibrations
I got your mind shaking, am I right?
My light gon' spark for generations
One day my voice will be heard on every radio station
Cause fake to real ratio changing and it's
Everyday living in this life I see
That in every way they wanna see my life decease
But I survive the question is for how long
Since my homie died, I been trying to hold on
The happy days of my life is now all gone
But I cope with that weed I smoke and writing these songs
But it's should I stay should I go? Oh!
Should I stay should I go? Oh!
I don't know, I don't know
Lord please let me know

Every thing cool like in the state of mind
That this state of mine correct, cool, calm, collect
Deflect the corrupt with intellect
I talk too much, the jig is up, he has risen up
From a division of most kings
With their vision, positioned for precision
It's mind splitting and soul uplifting
But still feel so trapped in the solar system
And we probably share a trait or two
But I can't see what I can't relate to
Hey, Jesus

Iron Man,Black Sabbath,1970,754032.0,https://genius.com/Black-Sabbath-Iron-Man-lyrics,"I am Iron Man
Has he lost his mind?
Can he see or is he blind?
Can he walk at all
Or if he moves, will he fall?
Is he alive or dead?
Has he thoughts within his head?
We'll just pass him there
Why should we even care?
He was turned to steel
In the great magnetic field
When he travelled time
For the future of mankind
Nobody wants him
He just stares at the world
Planning his vengeance
That he will soon unfurl
Now the time is here
For Iron Man to spread fear
Vengeance from the grave
Kills the people he once saved
Nobody wants him
They just turn their heads
Nobody helps him
Now he has his revenge
Heavy boots of lead
Fills his victims full of dread
Running as fast as they can
Iron Man lives again"

Yeah, I'm rocking camo pants but I ain't tryna hunt

Pull up in Corolla, purple drank, but it's soda

Like I'm Yoda, ayy, yuh, like I'm Yoda

This bed's empty without you
You said you're moving on
But I'm having some trouble getting there
But dwelling ain't getting me, uhh, anywhere
Fuckin' Valentine's Day
Fuck February, stuffed teddy bear, guts everywhere
Machete on the floor, I smashed up every mirror
Yeah, how do I look?
You fuckin' just left me here to die didn't you?
Why didn't you respond yet?
I've written you five or six different times and
I'm gettin' sick and tired of always apologizing to you
I didn't do shit to deserve what you're puttin' me through
This couldn't be true, we can't be over
So violets are blue, roses are red
Why is it everything I do I'm reminded of you?
Saw two white coffins in my dreams last night
I saw my Lord Jesus with his hands pointed toward the light
Saw my old sweetheart, she said, ""Honey, I'm back""
Just so you don't die alone, just so you don't die alone
Guess I gotta deal with the fact that, you ain't never comin' back
Now every woman that I look at I'm lookin' for you
So I'm findin' something the matter with them
Excuse to not see anyone
Useless, rather pick up the phone, not at all, followin' protocol
I get bold like bowling balls
Grow balls and go to call to talk, forget what I want to say
Damnit I'm drawin' blanks like I'm playin' hangman
I'm sick of playin' these games, I can't handle this heartbreak
It's makin' me wanna blow out my brains
Like birthday cake candles
Hang up the phone and I shake, I think I may have made a mistake
Can't escape the madness
Turn the radio on, I hate this sad song
But I can't even change the station
The same one's playin' on eight channels
I lay awake in shambles, I'm startin to hallucinate
I'm havin' all these visions of us at each other's wakes
In caskets and suddenly I wake and that's when I know I
Saw two white coffins in my dreams last night
I saw my Lord Jesus with his hands pointed toward the light
Saw my old sweetheart, she said, ""Honey, I'm back""
Just so you don't die alone, just so you don't die alone
Give me one more, bottle for the pain
Give me one more for the memories
Give me one more, I'll make it taste like a steak
It'll help alleviate
It'll soothe this ache
Of trying to fake
That she's really, she's really coming back
And it's been a while now, but I finally realize how
Much reality sucks, but it's just something about our love
I'm still in denial now, dealing with the finality of
And it's making me crazy thinking of the days we, spent
And how I'll never hold you again
And there ain't shit I can do about it
Now my head is overcrowded
With these clouded memories and I can't seem to get you out it
And how the fuck do you sleep comfortably
Knowing what you done did to me, huh?
Did it even occur to you that I loved you?
Completely, deep, and madly head over heels for you?
Was you and me, once used to be together forever
It was supposed to be us, but you crushed the dream
We was supposed to die together, and it's killing me so much
When I sleep I wake up dead, must be why I
Saw two white coffins in my dreams last night
I saw my Lord Jesus with his hands pointed toward the light
Saw my old sweetheart, she said, ""Honey, I'm back""
Just so you don't die alone, just so you don't die alone"

Like a Stone,Audioslave,2003,1193555.0,https://genius.com/Audioslave-Like-a-Stone-lyrics,"On a cobweb afternoon in a room full of emptiness
By a freeway, I confess I was lost in the pages
Of a book full of death, reading how we'll die alone
And if we're good, we'll lay to rest anywhere we wanna go
In your house, I long to be
Room by room, patiently
I'll wait for you there like a stone
I'll wait for you there alone
And on my deathbed, I will pray to the gods and the angels
Like a pagan to anyone who will take me to heaven
To a place I recall, I was there so long ago
The sky was bruised, the wine was bled, and there you led me on
In your house, I long to be
Room by room, patiently
I'll wait for you there like a stone
I'll wait for you there alone, alone
And I sat in regret of all the things I've done
For all that I've blessed and all that I've wronged
In dreams until my death, I will wander on
In your house, I long to be
Room by room, patiently
I'll wait for you there like a stone
I'll wait for you there alone, alone"

Only if you down and you slurp good D up
If the work good I'll be back for the re-up
Hate when I creep and the phone wake me up
Fake like I'm sleep knowing damn well I be up
Monkey on my back and I walk a hundred miles
Guilt make a nigga feel fake when he smile
Love get confused in the mind of a child
'Cause love wouldn't lie like I lie and it's wild
Wanna have my cake and another cake too
Even if the baker don't bake like you
Even when the flavor don't taste like you
So I'm back mobbing with the late night crew
All in your mind with fears that would come true
The back of my mind, the back of my mind was you
Wishing that I could blind myself from view
And only have eyes, and only have eyes for you
Slip me a xanny at once (somebody)
I got the earth in a blunt (smoke)
I get the skirt when I want (skrrt!)
I get the skirt when I want (skrrt!)
Due to the money aroma (somebody)
My girl she got a diploma (smoke)
She got wife written all over
She got wife written all over
I'm a fake nigga and it's never been clearer
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
I'm a fake nigga and it's never been clearer
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
Can't see myself when I look in the mirror
She my number one I don't need nothing on the side
Said that I was done for good and don't want no more lies
But my phone be blowing up, temptations on my line
I stare at the screen a while before I press decline
But she plants a seed and it still lingers in my mind
Told myself I'm strong enough to shake it and I'm trying
But I'm only human, I know loving you's a crime
If I take this cookie now one day I'll do the time
My ego get stroked and I bruise her
My ego get stroked and I bruise her
On the road I'm a mack, I'm a chooser
I'm a addict, I'm maskin' that
Kevin's Heart
They tell me ""What's done in the dark
Will find a way to shine""
I done did so much that when you see you might go blind
What's done in the dark will always find a way to shine
I done did so much that when you see you might go blind"

Stars are on the ground, you start to believe it
Every face along the boulevard

You looked at death in a tarot card
And you saw what you had to do
Nights at the chateau, trapped in your sunset bungalow
Drink of paradise, they told you, put your blood on ice
You're not gonna make it

Smoking, lokin', drinking that potion, you can see me swerving

I remember you took me to the mall last week, baby
You looked me in my eyes about four, five times
'Til I was hypnotized, then you clarified
That I (Want you)
You said Sherane ain't got nothing on Lucy
I said, ""You crazy?""
Roses are red, violets are blue
But me and you both pushing up daisies if I (Want you)

'Cause I (Want you)
You said to me, you said your name was Lucy
I said, ""Where's Ricardo?""
You said, ""Oh, no, not the show""
Then you spit a little rap to me like this
When I turned twenty-six, I was like, ""Oh, shit""
You said to me, I remember what you said too, you said:
""My name is Lucy, Kendrick, you introduced me, Kendrick
Usually I don’t do this but I see you and me, Kendrick
Lucy give you no worries, Lucy got million stories
About these rappers that I came after when they was boring
Lucy gon' fill your pockets
Lucy gon' move your mama out of Compton
Inside the gi-gantic mansion like I promised
Lucy just want your trust and loyalty, avoiding me?
It's not so easy, I'm at these functions accordingly
Kendrick, Lucy don't slack a minute, Lucy work harder
Lucy gon' call you even when Lucy know you love your Father
I'm Lucy,
I loosely heard prayers on your first album, truly
Lucy don't mind, 'cause at the end of the day you'll pursue me
Lucy go get it, Lucy not timid, Lucy up front
Lucy got paperwork on top of paperwork
I want you to know that Lucy got you
All your life I watched you
And now you all grown up to sign this contract, if that’s possible""
Get you, get you, get you, get you
I'ma go hit the throttle with you
Smoking, lokin', poking that doja 'til I'm idle with you
'Cause I (Want you)
Now, baby, when I'm riding here, I'm riding dirty
Registration is out of service
Smoking, lokin', drinking that potion, you can see me swerving
'Cause I (Want you)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhhh, ohh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhhh, ohh
I remember you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went runnin' for answers
Until I came home"

I've always been motivated by comments from people tellin' me things they think I'll never be

Okay, look, I'm honest, girl, I can't lie, I miss you
You and the music were the only things that I'd commit to
I never cheated, for the record, back when I was with you
But you believed in everything but me, girl, I don't get you
She says, ""I know you changed
I never see you 'cause you're always busy doin' things""
I really wish she had a different way of viewin' things
I think the city that we're from just kinda ruined things
It's such a small place, not much to do but talk and listen
The men are jealous and the women all in competition
Prayin' for your happiness, hope that you recover, uh
This is one I know you hated when you heard it
And it's worse because you know that I deserve it
Take a shot for me (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh)

I feel like Meek on a private jet
Trust that, P's in the trap, disgustin'
Stick with the stick, PVA, PDA, kiss that in public

Elastic bands, plastic bags, two and a blue like cheese and onion

My empress, still gonna impress

Public affection, I tell her, ""Come kiss me""
I like mine obsessed, clingy
If she don't miss me, miss me
If she don't miss me, history
If she don't miss me, it's a mystery

Don't drink, that's risky

And why my girlfriend never wanna see me have a good time out if she ain't there?
Seein' them stars on her private story
I dust that chick, she got no grace
Free my gang, 013's and 020's
Oh God knows, I miss my bros
I just got a call from jail on the phone and that might
Fill my heart with song
And let me sing forevermore

It’s lonely walking down this road
The same ones that fucked me over and whenever I need 'em and I turn around they just turn–ghost
I am depressed and it hurts me to know
I am so stressed and I hate being home
I’m sick and tired of putting up a front
Like I’m happy, but really I am in a slump
Addicted to bein' accepted’s like a drug
Teachers persuading me to try to give up my act
They said the image and the drive is what I lack
Made me think maybe I could never be a part of rap
Well, I ignored that, I said, ""Fuck it,"" and snapped
It’s hard to see Heaven when you know you're Hell-bound
And now I’m here and I look back, I’m screamin', ""Damn it""

Adorned with patches of places you’ve been
Is nothing on my khaki coat that I got
From a roadside when I was sixteen
My boots are from airports, my backpacks from friends
I'm not a man of substance and so I'll pretend
To be a wanderer, wandering
Leaving ascetic belongings in hostels and restaurant bins
Cut that bit out *laughs*
The roads are my home as horizon’s my target
But I keep on moving, never lose sight of it
Treating my memory of you like a fire, let it
Burn out, don't fight it and try to move on
It's been sixty weeks since I saw Vienna
A bandage and a wide smile slapped across my face
I'll pick up my hiking boots when I am ready
And I'll put down my roots when I'm dead
The distance is futile
Come on, don't be hasty
You'll get that feeling deep inside your bones
I’ll be gone then when you must be alone"

The girls see I got the money
Hundred-dollar bills, y'all

Well, I've had just enough time
If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time
And I'll be wearing white when I come into your kingdom
I'm as green as the ring on my little cold finger
I've never known the lovin' of man
But it sure felt nice when he was holdin' my hand
There's a boy here in town, says he'll love me forever
Who would have thought forever could be severed by
The sharp knife of a short life
Well, I've had just enough time
So put on your best, boys, and I'll wear my pearls
What I never did is done
A penny for my thoughts—oh no, I'll sell 'em for a dollar
They're worth so much more after I'm a goner
And maybe then you'll hear the words I've been singin'
Funny when you're dead, how people start listenin'
If I die young, bury me in satin
Lay me down on a bed of roses
Sink me in the river at dawn
Ooh, ooh, the ballad of a dove
Go with peace and love
Gather up your tears, keep 'em in your pocket
Save 'em for a time when you're really gonna need 'em"

We've probably never struggled coping, but I never want to
Promise again that I would call her
Forget the time 'cause I'm seven hours behind
It's probably good I didn't call though, but I always want to
And I'd beg you, but you know I'm never home
And I'd love you, but I need another year alone
And I've tried to ignore it every time you phone
But I never come close
And I don't think through things, I never get time
'Cause I don't think things through
Larry, call a load of smoke in, I wanna disappear for days
We've probably never struggled sleeping, but I never want to
Promise again that I would call her

If I got to choose a coast, I got to choose the East
I live out there, so don't go there

All I got is beef with those that violate me

Is it weakness?
You decide
Are we gonna live or die?
So I was takin' a walk the other day
And I seen a woman—a blind woman
Pacin' up and down the sidewalk
She seemed to be a bit frustrated
As if she had dropped somethin' and
Havin' a hard time findin' it
So after watchin' her struggle for a while
I decide to go over and lend a helping hand, you know?
""Hello, ma'am, can I be of any assistance?
It seems to me that you have lost something
I would like to help you find it""
She replied, ""Oh, yes, you have lost something
You've lost… your life""
Is it wickedness?
Lamar stated his views on police brutality
With that line in the song, quote
""And we hate the popo, wanna kill us in the street fo' sho'""

There's this image of you and I

Like in my heart there's that hotel suite
And you lived there so long
It's kind of strange now you're gone
I'm not sure if I should show you what I've found
Has it gone for good, or is it coming back around?
Isn't it hard to make up your mind
When you're losing and your fuse is fireside?
There's all those places we used to go
And I suspect you already know
But that place on memory lane you like still looks the same
But something about it's changed
I'm not sure if I should show you what I've found
Has it gone for good, or is it coming back around?
Isn't it hard to make up your mind
When you're losing and your fuse is fireside?
And I thought I was yours forever
Or maybe I was mistaken
But I just cannot manage to make it through the day

Here comes Marshall, he's on your street
Flavor my favorite graham crackers with JonBenét Rams'
I guess a modern-day Jack the Ripper is all that I am
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
But I can hear you, my love, you keep calling me
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
I foam like a Doberman, mouth open, I overdose
Put coke up my nostrils in both my holes, then I plug my nose
My pupils quadruple in size, eyes are so bugged, I know
I put on my mother's makeup
I think I'm down to a hundred pounds
There's thunder, I wonder how come it rains, but the sun is out?
The devil's upset with his wife, they must be sluggin' it out
I must be buggin' the fuck out, but what the fuck about?
Voices are leading me up to the attic, I love my house
They pull and they tug my blouse, the sound of a music box
Comes from inside a toy chest, but what do I do? It's locked
I pick it and open it, but it's stuffed full of human parts
I dig 'til I find it, I wind it up, and the tune just starts
It's playing a song, so beautiful, and the room is dark
The moon is full, I smell a funeral, guess I'll loom in the park
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
But I can hear you, my love, you keep calling me
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
This little chick's neck like a Pixy Stick
through the back door slippin'
Through the crack
The mortician of love, sent from above
Been doing this for more than a quarter-century,
Am I dreaming, is it real? Someone pinch me on the buns
Zoom in with the lens, then pan back the camera
Stand back, 'cause here comes your man Jack, so Pamela
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
But I can hear you, my love, you keep calling me
Although we're worlds apart, you mean the world to me

um
King Duncan
What bloody man is that? he can report,
As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt
The newest state.
MALCOLM
This is the sergeant
Who, like a good and hardy soldier, fought
'Gainst my captivity. —Hail, brave friend!
Say to the King the knowledge of the broil
As thou didst leave it.
Doubtful it stood,
As two spent swimmers that do cling together
And choke their art.
The merciless Macdonwald
Worthy to be a rebel,
The multiplying villainies of nature
Do swarm upon him
from the Western Isles
Of kerns
And Fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,
Showed like a rebel's whore.
too
weak
For brave Macbeth (well he deserves that name),
Disdaining Fortune, with his brandished steel,
Which smoked with bloody execution,
Like valor's minion, carved out his passage
Till he faced the slave;
Which ne'er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,
Till he unseamed him from the nave to th' chops,
And fixed his head upon our battlements.
O valiant cousin, worthy gentleman!
As whence the sun 'gins his reflection
Shipwrecking storms and direful thunders [break'],
So from that spring whence comfort seemed to come
Discomfort swells
Compelled these skipping kerns to trust their heels,
But the Norweyan lord, surveying vantage,
new supplies of men,
Dismayed not this our captains, Macbeth and Banquo?
Yes, as sparrow eagles, or the hare the lion.
I must they were
As cannons overcharged with double cracks,
So they doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe.
Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds
Or memorize another Golgotha,
But I am faint
My gashes cry for help.
So well thy words become thee as thy wounds:
They smack of honor both. -Go, get him surgeons.
MALCOLM
What a haste looks through his eyes!
So should he look that seems to speak things strange.
God save the King.
Whence cam'st thou, worthy thane?
Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky
And fan our people cold.
Norway himself, with terrible numbers,
Assisted by that most disloyal traitor,
The Thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict,
Till that Bellona's bridegroom, lapped in proof,
Confronted him with self-comparisons,
And to conclude,
The victory fell on us.
DUNCAN
Great happiness!
That now Sweno,
The Norway's king
Nor would we deign him burial of his men
Till he disbursed at Saint Colme's Inch
Ten thousand dollars to our general use.
No more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceive
Go, pronounce his present death,
And with his former title greet Macbeth.
I'll see it done.
What he hath lost, noble Macbeth hath won."

Picking through the cards, knowing what's nearby
The carvings on the face say they find it hard
And the engine's failed again, all limits of disguise
The humor's not the same, coming from denial

Giddy with delight, seeing what's to come
The image of the dead, dead ends in my mind
Policemen swear to God, love seeping from their guns
I know my friends and I would probably turn and run
If you get out of bed,
come find us heading
For the bridge, bring a stone, all the rage,

I pretend that you were just some lover

I doubt that comes as a surprise
And I can't think of anything to dream about
I can't find anywhere to hide
And when I'm hanging on by the rings around my eyes
And I convince myself I need another
And for a minute, it gets easier
To pretend that you were just some lover

Singing dreadful songs about summer

Pretending you were just some lover?

I Need a Doctor,Dr. Dre,2011,1058853.0,https://genius.com/Dr-Dre-I-Need-a-Doctor-lyrics,"I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life
I told the world, one day, I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it
So that one day I could play it back
But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm sayin' that
Hope, I just need a ray of that, 'cause no one sees my vision
When I play it for 'em, they just say it's wack
But they don't know what dope is
And I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me,
I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me, you lost a son
Demons fightin' you,
it's dark
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me, and enlighten you
I don't think you realize what you mean to me
'Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick
You gon' either wanna fight when I get off this fuckin' mic
Or you gon' hug me, but I'm outta options
There's nothin' else I can do 'cause—
I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I need a doctor
Call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life
It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces, so I'm puzzled
'Cause the shit I hear is crazy
I can endure no more, I demand you remember who you are
It was you who believed in me
When everyone was tellin' you don't sign me
Everyone at the fuckin' label, let's tell the truth
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy
Dre, I'm cryin' in this booth
You saved my life, now, maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I ain't givin' up faith, and you ain't givin' up on me
Get up, Dre, I'm dyin', I need you
Come back, for fuck's sake, 'cause—
I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life
It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday, though
You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke
Went through friends, some of them I put on, but they just left
They said they was ridin' to the death
But where the fuck are they now, now that I need them?
I don't see none of them, all I see is Slim
Fuck all you fair-weather friends, all I need is him
Fuckin' backstabbers
When the chips were down, you just laughed at us
Now you 'bout to feel the fuckin' wrath of Aftermath, faggots
And the cracker's ass,
little cracker jack beat
Makin' wack-ass backwards producers, I'm back, bastards
One more CD, and then I'm packin' up my bags
And as I'm leavin',
I'll guarantee they'll scream
""Dre, don't leave us like that, man,"" 'cause—
I'm about to lose my mind
You've been gone for so long
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor

Shake like the bough of a willow tree
You are the rite of movement
Its reasonin' made lucid and cool
And though it's no improvement
When you move, I move
You're less Polunin leapin'
Or Fred Astaire in sequins
Honey, you, you're Atlas in his sleepin'

Dispel doubt, but you won't admit I smoked

Pockets on swoll 'cause I move the O's

Them Golf Boys is in this bitch like an infant
The blind niggas used to make fun of my vision
And now I pay a mortage and they stuck with tuition
So special, the teacher asked if I was autistic
And now I'm making plates, you just washing the dishes
So if you don't mind, get the fuck out of my kitchen

Than coming out the closet to conservative Christian fathers

She wanted to talk; ""Who's in charge of this Golf shit?""

No, no, give yourself a hand
Better pose for that camera
You better pose, boy, you better pose
And it's your life, nigga, I suppose
For the lights, for the camera, and the action
Now your face is meltin' from the flash of the big ol' lights
Nigga, you ask for this life
Welcome to death camp

Yeah, welcome to death camp
Your lips high-five my tongue
And my fingers moonwalk through your hair

Welcome to hell camp

The question which I probably won’t find an answer to my whole life
I'm still not so sure if I'm a dog or a pig or what else
But then other people come out and put the pearl necklace on me
I dreamt of becoming a superhero
Now it feels like I really became one
But as it goes on there’s so much blabbering
One says, ""Run"" another says, ""Stop""
This one says, ""Look at the forest"" that one says, ""Look at the wild flower""
My shadow, I wrote and called it hesitation
It has never hesitated after becoming that
It keeps appearing under the stage or the light
Keeps glaring at me scorchingly like a heat wave (Oh shit)
Hey, have you already forgotten why you even started this?
You were just digging it that someone was listening
The regrets that I don't even get sick of anymore
I tumble with them every night until I'm disgusted
And twist the irreversible time habitually
The three syllables of my name and the word 'but' that should come before any of those
So I'm askin' once again yeah
Who the hell am I?
Tell me all your names baby
Do you wanna die?
Do you wanna fly?
Where's your dream?
My name is R
The 'me' that I remember and people know
The 'me' that I created myself to vent out
Yeah, maybe I have been deceiving myself
Maybe I've been lying
But I'm not embarrassed anymore this is the map of my soul
Dear myself
You must never lose your temperature
'Cause you don't need to be neither warm nor cold
The 'me' that I want myself to be
The 'me' that people want me to be
The 'me' that you love
And the 'me' that I create
The 'me' that's smiling
The me that's sometimes in tears
Persona
Who the hell am I?
I just wanna fly
I just wanna give you all the voices 'til I die
Who the hell am I?
I just wanna fly
I just wanna give you all the voices 'til I die

I need a new face, I'm tired of these weirdos acting familiar
Took all the rock and turned it to pop, he think that he Elvis
Richard Mille, look at my ears, flooded with diamonds
Look at my skills, running through blocks like 49ers
Forty-nine diamonds, stuffed in my bracelet
That cost a whop, that cost a whopper
And it ain't new, I had a knot at John Ehret in my locker
Skin hot when they tried me, like them poppers feel
Hands shaking, norepinephrine levels skyrocket, fuel, rocket"

Her bacon slammin' but her eggs get runny—funny
So many bombs, you'd think Flex get money from me
Cole world but my neck get sunny
Now I don't fuck around with hoes from reality shows
Or blow-up dolls, 'cause I don't like havin' sex with dummies, love me
No disrespect meant, honey, this just a compilation of my observations
While trapped in this God-forsaken nation

No. 1 Party Anthem,Arctic Monkeys,2013,828578.0,https://genius.com/Arctic-Monkeys-No-1-Party-Anthem-lyrics,"So you're on the prowl wondering whether
She left already or not
Leather jacket, collar popped like antenna
Never knowin' when to stop
Sunglasses indoors
Par for the course
Lights in the floors and sweat on the walls
Cages and poles
Call off the search for your soul
Or put it on hold again
She's having a sly indoor smoke
And she calls the folks who run this, her oldest friends
Sippin' her drink and laughin' at imaginary jokes
As all the signals are sent, her eyes invite you to approach
And it seems as though those lumps in your throat
That you just swallowed have got you going
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Number one party anthem
She's a certified mind blower
Knowing full well that I know
May suggest there's somewhere from which I might know her
Just to get the ball to roll
Drunken monologues, confused because
It's not like I'm falling in love, I just want you
To do me no good
And you look like you could
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Number one party anthem
Come on, come on, come on
Before the moment's gone
Number one party anthem, yeah, yeah
The look of love, the rush of blood
The ""She's with me""s, the Gallic shrug
The shutterbugs, the Camera Plus
The black & white and the colour dodge
The good time girls, the cubicles
The house of fun,
the number one
Party anthem, oh
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on

Waterfalls,TLC,1994,1168411.0,https://genius.com/TLC-Waterfalls-lyrics,"A lonely mother gazing out of the window
Staring at a son that she just can't touch
If at any time he's in a jam, she'll be by his side
But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much
But all the praying just ain't helping at all
'Cause he can't seem to keep himself out of trouble
So he goes out and he makes his money the best way he knows how
Another body laying cold in the gutter
Listen to me
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast
Little precious has a natural obsession for temptation
But he just can't see
She gives him loving that his body can't handle
But all he can say is, ""Baby, it's good to me""
One day, he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror
But he doesn't recognize his own face
His health is fading, and he doesn't know why
Three letters took him to his final resting place
Y'all don't hear me
Don't go chasing waterfalls

but too many storms
Have come and gone, leaving a trace of not one God-given ray
Is it because my life is ten shades of gray?
I pray all ten fade away
seldom praise Him for the sunny days
And like His promise is true
only my faith can undo
The many chances I blew to bring my life to anew
Clear blue and unconditional skies
Have dried the tears from my eyes, no more lonely cries
My only bleeding hope is for the folk who can't cope
With such an endurin' pain that it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain
Who's to blame for tooting 'caine into your own vein?
What a shame, you shoot and aim for someone else's brain
You claim the insane, and name this day in time
For falling prey to crime
I say the system got you victim to your own mind
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're movin' too fast
Don't go chasing waterfalls (
Don't go, don't go

Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all (

I used to be jealous of Arron Afflalo
He was the one to follow
He was the only leader foreseeing brighter tomorrows
He would live in the gym, we was living in sorrow
Total envy of him, he made his dream become a reality
Actually making it possible to swim
It's 2004 and I'm watching him score thirty
'Cause every basket was a reaction or a reminder
That we was just moving backwards
The bungalow where you find us
The art of us ditching classes, heading nowhere fast
Stick my head inside the study hall, he focused on math
Determination ambition, plus dedication and wisdom
Qualities he was given was the shit we didn't have
Dug inside of his book bag and Coach Palmer asked for his finals
He had his back like a spinal, meanwhile
We singing the same old song spinning the vinyl
Eleven graders gone wrong
Now watch that black boy fly

I used to be jealous of Jayceon Taylor when I was young
Taylor made a career out of music from writing songs
It's 2004 and I'm hearing the people roar
For the name of The Game, they line in front of the store
Swap meets, selling our mixtapes, I'm like, ""Oh shit, wait""
Don't wanna be another nigga stuck regretting mistakes
Mixed feelings was my opinion, I was defending my insecurities
A tall nigga hopped out with Jordans and a white tank top
He was top of the rap game, we was the top of the block
Regardless of where you stay, hold your head and continue marching
That's what she said, but in my head I wanted to be like Jordan
Award touring the country with money from mic recording
And shortly, I got discouraged
Like every time I walked to the corner, had them guns bursting
Nigga, I was rehearsing in repetition the phrase
That only one in a million will ever see better days
Especially when the crime waves was bigger than tsunamis
Break your boogie boards to pieces,
All these niggas facetious and they all standing beside me
They all'll buy me a chopper if any one of you try me"

Take a run, take a run with me
Where the sky is blue forever
'Til the end of time
And dear, buddy don't you cry when she goes
'Cause life is cynical despite your heart of gold
Oh, no, buddy don't you cry as they go
Life makes us critical and all, we gotta change the course
Oh-oh-oh
Where the sky is blue forever
Oh-oh-oh
Where the sky is blue forever
Love is a dangerous business you know
Who's gonna care for your bleeding soul?
Take a run, take a run with me
Where the sky is blue forever
'Til the end of time

Where the sky is blue forever

Take a run, we can all be free

And the pack hella musty, smell like some BO
You buying more than one, then I might cut a deal
And the pack hella musty, smell like some BO
Tryna hit a lick, you get hit with the lasers
Got your bitch on the way, she got a dick appointment
Good lean in my cup, every sip I enjoy
Its a fee for the 'Gees, make her G off her knees
I ain't tryna be the P, but she begged on her knees

I ain't tryna have babies right now, so we fuck with the rubber, but I got a raw bitch
Can't believe that I'm still in the 'partments
on Sparks Street
I done ran up them motherfuckin' commas, look at lil' Dominique
I'ma shoot by myself like a technical foul
Better not reach for my chain when I jump in the crowd
Lambo' so low, gotta squat
We finally made it, let's pop us some bottles
I took the lead and let everyone follow
They know I'm runnin' it right to the bank
They want me to ease up, I didn't leave 'em any breathin' room, sorry, I told 'em, ""I can't""
Heard you a rat, so you know what's gon' happen whenever we catch you
Peep all the moves I been makin', by time I get forty, I gotta be one of them greats
She on that '42 straight with no chaser

44 Bars,Logic,2016,839530.0,https://genius.com/Logic-44-Bars-lyrics,"If you deal with war, backwards stay far
We're dealing with truths and rights
Come some more into my sight
(You no hear me yet?)
(Hear me live and direct)
(Walk with your tap
)
Yeah, in London talkin' to rhêtorík 'bout my life and shit
I thought the album was finished but I keep writing shit
It's kind of funny how life changed and rearranged
No matter what happens, everything ain't gon' be the same
The incredible album, what an incredible outcome
I grip the mic and then talk to the people like I'm Malcolm
I used to think the fame and money was the motivation
Until I toured the world and met the people face to face and
Understood that the power was harnessed in that basement
It ain't about the money and notoriety
It's about the people and making a difference in society
But don't get it twisted, this life I'm living is like a movie
The Godfather, the Goodfella wielding a Uzi
One with the people, if the people is wondering who's he?
Same level, the same rebel that never settled
Pullin' strings like Geppetto
who overcame the ghetto
And I know you wrote me and I still ain't answered
'Cause shit is different now, it's forced upon me, different stances
I used to spend all of my time conversing with you
But now I write this song to let you know I'm hurting with you
it's kinda bittersweet
Besides the shows and meet and greets, y'all only see me on the street
And even then, that shit is rare—I just don't go outside
'Cause honestly, I don't fuck with this world, I'd rather hide
That misconception, ""'Cause I rap, I must be filled with pride""
Shit, I ain't perfect, if you heard different then someone lied
People in my ear telling me, ""Talk that shit""
Actions speak louder than words, I'd rather walk that shit
Since the first album, I'm one of the highest earners on the label
Within six months, I put the second one on they table
I played sold out shows in parts of the world I can't pronounce
Release the tickets, watch them disappear when we announce
Fuck all that murderous syllable shit right now, just let me bounce
The mood around me is people smokin' it by the ounce
Leave Friday for the show and come back Monday with a hundred grand
Don't fuck with checks, so when I bounce I prefer cash in hand
You know my first week looking crazy due to high demand
There's ups and downs, don't get me wrong but back when I ain't have shit
Felt like I woulda sold my soul to make it with this rap shit
Thank God he never let Lucifer close enough to ask
Let me attain it by workin' hard and busting my ass
Achieved a lot in life, but what's a lot with more to gain?
At least I don't drink to avoid the hurt, we call that champagne
Come some more into my sight..."

To have a voice in the back of my head
Like a face that I hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches every time I lie
A face that laughs every time I fall
(And watches everything)
So I know that when it's time to sink or swim
That the face inside is here in me
Right underneath my skin
It's like a whirlwind inside of my head
I know I've got a face in me
Points out all my mistakes to me
You've got a face on the inside, too
And your paranoia's probably worse
Everybody acts like the fact of the matter
Is I can't add up to what you can
But everybody has a face that they hold inside
A face that awakes when I close my eyes
A face that watches every time they lie
A face that laughs every time they fall

Came up in a world that's off its axis

I'm stuck in a clinic like Flynn Montgomery
Creeping through fireside
Smash the window of that fire ride

Prayin' to God up in Heaven, eleven at night and I got no alibi

If you exist, you got a funny way of showing it

Like track four, ""Kick in the Door"" by Notorious B.I.G. 
Don't believe me, look that shit up, I promise you'll find the key
Snap my fingers like Thanos and Bobby Boy bringin' the doom
'Cause I'm 6:30, killin' shit, hands down and dirty

To let her know what I'm gon' do
Sample ""Dreamflower"" by Tarika Blue
That's cool with you?
Yeah, that's fine, baby, all gravy
Long as you know you my baby
And that beat yo' daddy like if he ever cheat on me
I mean she don't own the sample but she might as well
'Cause her and Dilla paved the way for all I got, and, well
I'ma show my gratitude, no attitude, no auto-tune like T-Pain
Doin'
Unplugged
, I'm unplugged, like Trinity
The greatest rapper alive is probably slacking producing
Introduce you to my train of thought
Snapping on a track like the illest conductor
I brought my heart to the table
Fact and never fiction, fuck a fable
Power through these lines faster than fiber-optic cable, I'm gone
You and me
