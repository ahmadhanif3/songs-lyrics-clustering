Why are my eyes filled with tears?
Hey, stay by my side and laugh
A future without you is a world without colour
Filled with monochrome coldness
[Chorus: Jungkook,

Even the darkness we see is so beautiful
Please believe me
Looking only directly at you
So you don't go away
Whatever lies in our way
Look far into the distance
The place you gave me is still
Where my heart entrusts
Shadows of the past keep on chasing me
But the more I try to escape and struggle, the more it follows
But I still want to hold onto it, wherever you are I'll find you
To a tomorrow of us","verse  jung kook

They call me Superman
Leap tall hoes in a single bound
I'm single now: got no ring on this finger now
I'd never let another chick bring me down
In a relationship; save it, bitch!
Babysit? You make me sick
Superman ain't savin' shit
Straight from the hip, cut to the chase
I tell a muhfuckin' slut to her face
Play no games, say no names
Ever since I broke up with what's-her-face
I'm a different man, kiss my ass
What, you tryin' to be my new wife?
What, you Mariah? Fly through twice
But I do know one thing though
Bitches, they come, they go
Saturday through Sunday, Monday (
Yeah-yeah
)
Monday through Sunday, yo
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow
'Til then just sit your drunk ass on that fuckin' runway, ho

Can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
I can't be your Superman, can't be your Superman
Can't be your Superman, your Superman, your Superman
Don't get me wrong, I love these hoes
It's no secret, everybody knows
We'll be friends, I'll call you again
I'll chase you around every bar you attend
Never know what kinda car I'll be in
We'll see how much you'll be partyin' then
Maybe I'll love you one day
Maybe we'll someday grow

Don't share your body with nobody—not even a finger
I will cut it off and let him keep it—that ass for Weezy, baby
And at my station, we have sex orientation

Roll, like sushi""; I'm tryna dip my celery up in her bleu cheese

Trade my 4x4 for a G63, ain't no more free Lil Steve
I gave 'em chance and chance and chance again, I even done told them please
I find it crazy the police'll shoot you and know that you dead, but still tell you to freeze
Fucked up, I seen what I seen
I guess that mean hold him down if he say he can't breathe
It's too many mothers that's grieving
They killing us for no reason
Been going on for too long to get even
First I was drunk, then I sobered up quick
We just some products of our environment
How the fuck they gon' blame us?
Every colored person ain't dumb and all whites not racist
I be judging by the mind and heart, I ain't really into faces
I see blue lights, I get scared and start runnin'
That shit be crazy, they 'posed to protect us
Throw us in handcuffs and arrest us
While they go home at night, that shit messed up
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear
Corrupted police been the problem where I'm from
But I'd be lying if I said it was all of them
Altercations with the law, had a lot of them
I can't lie like I don't rap about killing and dope, but I'm telling my youngins to vote
I did what I did 'cause I didn't have no choice or no hope, I was forced to just jump in and go
This bullshit is all that we know, but it's time for a change
Got time to be serious, no time for no games
We ain't takin' no more, let us go from them chains
God bless they souls, every one of them names
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere
Might as well gon' 'head start here
We done had a hell of a year
I'ma make it count while I'm here
God is the only man I fear
They trainin' officers to kill us, then shootin' protestors with these rubber bullets
What happened to COVID? Nobody remember
It's bigger than black and white
It's a problem with the whole way of life
It can't change overnight
But we gotta start somewhere

""Hey man, how's everything going brother? Oh, just taking it easy, hanging out with the old lady. Alright, God bless you, take it easy now, alright."" You be like that nigga ain't like that
You see him by himself, ""What's up Tony?"" ""Hey, where's the bitches at, nigga?! Where's the bitches?!""
Yeah
Gimme my space,
Lord, ain't enough time to chase
All these dreams, nah mean? I got no time to wait
Love my girl, but I told her straight up, ""Don't wait up""
we fucked and made up
Used to living free as a bird, but now I'm laid up
Feelin' like a nigga got handcuffs on
How the fuck did my life become a damn love song?
She ride for a nigga and she stand up for him
But a nigga wan' be a nigga, be a nigga
Ride through the streets with freaks and real niggas
She'll never understand what it's like to be a man
Knowin' when you look inside yourself you see a nigga
And you don't wan' let her down
But you too young for the settle down
And maybe you can thug it out
learn what is love about
When you can't live with her and you can't live without
Aw shit, goddamn, I think the devil got his hands on me
Stripper saying, ""Baby, won't you throw them bands on me?""
And I came to spend
She pop a molly, let the motherfuckin' games begin
Runaway, runaway
Runaway, runaway
I'm holdin' on
Desperately
Runaway, runaway
Runaway, runaway
I'm holdin' on
When it's all said and done everybody dies
In this life ain't no happy endings
Only pure beginnings followed by years of sinning and fake repentance
The preacher say we were made in image of Lord
To which I replied: ""Are you sure?
Even a murderer? Even a whore?
Even a nigga running through bitches on tour
With a good girl at home folding clothes and shit?""
She losin' faith in him and he knows the shit
Like, ""What the fuck is a break? Don't know how much I can take no more
I give you all I got 'til it ain't no more
No more tears, it's been ten long years
Damn near, I don't know if I can wait no more""
And who can blame her, you complain about
Every time you out
you come back she poutin'
Sleeping back to back, this is wack
we 'bout
To go platinum and I'm in the crib acting out
My childhood fantasies of wife and home
But it's a whole lot of actresses I'd like to bone
And despite the rumors you hold out
On account of your guilt
and she has got to spend her nights alone
And she ride or die like Eve and 'em
Make home-cooked meals every evenin'
And even in your lowest days
When you're no longer Superman, at least you know you got Lois Lane
But you
Runaway, runaway
Runaway, runaway
I'm holdin' on
Desperately
Runaway, runaway

Unbelievable, seen evil that not even Knievel know
At age three I knew this world was three below
Listen, even though my ego low, achieved the unachievable
Imagine if my confidence was halfway decent yo
This just in, fucked more bitches than Bieber though
Still I keep it low, got my niggas on the need to know
Basis
my manager back in the days was racist
I was a young boy, passing skates and tucking laces
Old perverted white man who told me, ""Jermaine
It's all pink on the inside, fuck what color they face is""
Wise words from an indecent man
Made me reflect on the times when we was three-fifths of them
In chains and powerless, brave souls reduced to cowardice
Slaving in the baking sun for hours just
To see the master creep into the shack where your lady at
Nine months later got a baby, that's
Not quite what you expected, but you
Refuse to neglect it, 'cause you
Know your wifey loves you
thus you refuse to accept it
That’s the type of shit that turned my granny light-skinned
Rich white men rule the nation still
Only difference is we all slaves now
the chains concealed
In our thoughts,
if I follow my heart to save myself
Could I run away from fifty-mill like Dave Chappelle?

Threw the bums a dime in your prime, didn't you?
People call, say ""Beware, doll, you're bound to fall""
You thought they were all a-kiddin' you
You used to laugh about
Everybody that was hangin' out
Now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging your next meal
How does it feel?
How does it feel
To be without a home
Like a complete unknown
Like a rolling stone?
Aw, you've gone to the finest school all right, Miss Lonely
But ya know ya only used to get juiced in it
Nobody's ever taught ya how to live out on the street
And now you’re gonna have to get used to it
You say you never compromise
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
He's not selling any alibis
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say, “Do you want to make a deal?""
With no direction home
A complete unknown
Aw, you never turned around to see the frowns
On the jugglers and the clowns when they all did tricks for you
Never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you
You used to ride on a chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a Siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discover that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything he could steal?
To hang on your own
With no direction home

They're all drinkin', thinkin' that they got it made
Exchangin' all precious gifts
But you'd better take your diamond ring, ya better pawn it, babe

At Napoleon in rags, and the language that he used

Now is the climax to the story
That gives the demons and angels purpose
They fly around while we are walking
And mold our emotions just to please them
I am cold, can you hear?
I will fly with no hope, no fear
And the ground taunts my wings
Plummet as I sing
Plummet as I sing
All we are is an isle of flightless birds
We find our worth in giving birth and stuff
We're lining our homes against winding roads
And we think the going is tough
We pick songs to sing
Remind us of things that nobody cares about
And honestly, we're probably
More suicidal than ever now
If you decide to live by
What you think's wrong and what's right
Believe me, you'll begin to wish you were sleeping
Your weeping will creep in your head and you'll cry
But if we wake up every morning
And decide what we believe
We can take apart our very heart
And the light will set us free

And please don't be afraid of what your soul is really thinking
Your soul knows good and evil, your soul knows both sides
And it's time you pick your battle
And I promise you, this is mine

I'm a phenomenon,
and I gotta bring pain in The Octagon
When I wanna spit game at a soccer mom
I get it quicker than the left lane on the Autobahn, fast
Like Ramadan,
had to battle young padawans all the damn day
I'm getting naked and I'm hopping on a wrecking ball
So hot, I got the motherfucker
a la flambé
I go to Miley's house, I see that Miley's home
I play Miley's ribcage with my dick, like it's a Xylie-phone
but my skills are highly honed
And if I was highly hyphy, I might be more widely-known
C'est la vie
, better pay my fee
They kick it in Seattle in a Patagonia jacket
They get it in the Bay in a plain white tee
Hey mami! You a P.Y.T
Cause, every time I get a beat, I know I gotta beat it up
I bend it then I break it then I chop it then I eat it up
And PETA would never approve of the way
I've been treating the music, I bleed it, I bruise it
I kick it to the curb
and then I'm sipping on my bourbon
I be freaking it, doing it, keeping it moving
I'm picking apart the muscle when I'm thinking about the hustle
But I'm nice, nice!
Woah, woah, woah
What do you take us for?
Woah, woah, woah

I jump the freeway median, I'm savage
Cause my mode is that I'm meaner than the average

when I heard the crowd applaud
I thought I was an atheist until I realized I'm a God
It could hurt a bit when I murder shit
In a moment, I'll be taking off a tourniquet
When I burn them and I hit them in the sternum
I don't even got to enter, but I'm gonna win the tournament
That's what I'm all about
And I hope that it would have been the end of it and I'm out
But they never tend to give me the benefit of the doubt
Ever since I was a little kid
I know that I've been looking for the hot, hot spotlight
And if you really wonder what I think about the competition
They were not-not-not tight
I've been reading my scripture
Every photo bomber wanna be in my picture
And you better bet I'm living every single day
Like it's the motherfucking Catalina Wine Mixer
Bada bing, bada boom!
When I walk in, I'm the king of the room
And I get it locked in like a king in a tomb
When I spit a toxin and they cough on the fumes
Cause I'm back in the nick of time and attacking the fickle mind
I'm a jackal, I'll rip his hide, I'ma tackle him, pick a fight
I be Dracula, set to bite
in the black of the bitter night
And I'm out, poof

they get it in the bay in a plain white tee
hey mami you a pyt
because every time i get a beat i know i got to beat it up
i bend it then i break it then i chop it then i eat it up
and peta would never approve of the way
i have been treating the music i bleed it i bruise it

LADY MACBETH
'They met me in the day of success: and I have
learned by the perfectest report, they have more in
them than mortal knowledge.
When I burned in
desire
to question them further, they made themselves air,
into which they vanished.
Whiles I stood rapt in
the wonder of it, came missives from the king
who
all-hailed me
'Thane of Cawdor
by which title,
before, these weird sisters saluted me, and referred
me to the coming on of time, with 'Hail, king that
shalt be!'
This have I thought good to deliver
thee, my dearest partner of greatness,
that thou
mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being
ignorant of what greatness is promised thee.
Lay it
to thy heart, and farewell.
Glamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be
What thou art promised:
yet do I fear thy nature;
It is too full o' the milk of human kindness
To catch the nearest way:
thou wouldst be great;
Art not without ambition, but without
The illness should attend it:
what thou wouldst highly,
That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,
And yet wouldst wrongly win:
thou'ldst have, great Glamis,
That which cries 'Thus thou must do, if thou have it;
And that which rather thou dost fear to do
Than wishest should be undone.
Hie thee hither,
That I may pour my spirits in thine ear;
And chastise with the valour of my tongue
All that impedes thee from the golden round,
Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem
To have thee crown'd withal.
What is your tidings?
Thou'rt mad to say it:
Is not thy master with him? who, were't so,
Would have inform'd for preparation.
So please you, it is true: our thane is coming:
One of my fellows had the speed of him,
Who, almost dead for breath, had scarcely more
Than would make up his message.
LADY MACBETH
Give him tending;
He brings great news.
The raven himself is hoarse
That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan
Under my battlements.
Come, you spirits
That tend on
mortal thoughts
unsex me here,
And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full
Of direst cruelty! make thick my blood;
Stop up the access and passage to remorse,
That no compunctious visitings of nature
Shake my fell purpose,
nor keep peace between
The effect and it!
Come to my woman's breasts,
And take my milk for gall, you murdering ministers,
Wherever in your sightless substances
You wait on nature's mischief!
Come, thick night,
And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell,
That my keen knife see not the wound it makes,
Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark,
To cry 'Hold, hold!'
Enter MACBETH
Great Glamis! worthy Cawdor!
Greater than both, by the all-hail hereafter!
Thy letters have transported me beyond
This ignorant present, and I feel now
The future in the instant.
My dearest love,
Duncan comes here to-night.
And when goes hence?
To-morrow, as he purposes.
O, never
Shall sun that morrow see!
Your face, my thane, is as a book where men
May read strange matters.
To beguile the time,
Look like the time; bear welcome in your eye,
Your hand, your tongue:
look like the innocent flower,
But be the serpent under't.
He that's coming
Must be provided for:
and you shall put
This night's great business into my dispatch;
Which shall to all our nights and days to come
Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom.
We will speak further.
Only look up clear;
To alter favour ever is to fear:
Leave all the rest to me.

Much younger than you are now

Tag on your soul, everybody got a price
Acid, acid, change your life
Bape if she hip, Saint Laurent if she bougie
I'm faded like Boosie
She call Meechy over, I slide in that coochie
Nosedive in that coochie
My dick is big, it should be wearin' a Coogi
I'm in Nice of France
Tie-dyed my lifestyle, even bleached the pants
Next week, Japan
Thom Browne bubble lens, eyes need the tint
Flatbush, Brooklyn, from the County of Kings
Run up on me like I'm some hippie nigga
And die under the knife, Joan Rivers
Ooh, damn, that punchline delivers
Hold up, wait a minute, moment of silence
Hm, fuck it, let's get back to wylin'
Blood on your Timbs, shoot you
Blood at your limbs, tuh-tuh
Slugs hit your rims
Ambidextrous, I shoot with two hands
Even got blood on your friends
I think I just flooded the Benz
Damn it, baby, Meechy's at it again
M-M-Murder, murder, murder
The capital M with two gats in my hand
Everyday a nigga wake up, got to blaze a little chronic
Thank the universe, a blessin', new day, a new dollar
Middle finger to my niggas and my bitches two times
Representin' for my niggas in the hood, it's no ceilin'
Sellin', trappin' like a villain, cold
Hate a nigga, fade him quicker now
I-I-I-I
High like the sun
Fetch a frequency, this ain't shit to me
Meech roll 'em, bust 'em, cannons, wooh
Spliff long, lookin' like a Manson
I'm on acid, feelin' like the Hamptons
Young nigga, but I'm still OG
Supreme Team like 1993
Triple six on my coffin, I dance with the Devil
Came back with a vengeance, Christ off the hinges
Psycho-active, I'm on a mission
Electric Kool-Ade, make your decision
These niggas ain't right, they can't write they own shit
But they smile in your face, and they claim they the shit
But to me a disgrace
Trying to keep steps ahead like we runnin' a race
Got an ounce to burn, got a trip to make
Throw that pussy, let me hit it
Girl, I got to get it
Back and forth 'cause we smoke them seven grams
Won't slip away, this is serious business
'Voidin the mischief while spendin' these Benjamins
Surrender potential pussy to me
Brought to you by the ungrateful police
Conscious keep tellin' me, beautiful melody
Will exhibit if I trip on the LSD
Nah, window for money and dro
flip like aerobics
Components will kill my opponents
I sit on my throne, it's enormous
Composed with the chorus
My bitch is so gorgeous, I cannot afford
To spend time with her when chasin' these whores
She strip like Lance Mountains
My passport is packed, how I travel, astoundin' (Yeah)
Thug Waffle, did that
Now we comin' back for the killer contract
Pull up on your pampers,

And fuck your loud pack, and fuck your Snapchat (Man...)
Cherry Bomb
 the greatest fuckin' album since the days of sound
And that shit gon' pop just like that nigga that was never 'round
Damn, 'bout to drop, gas 'em up, thick exhaust (Woo)
Young T, came quick, hard to beat, dick is soft
We ain't lyin', we the truth, call him Simba, beast is loose
Tyler, The Creator sweatin' Jesus juice
Put that fuckin' cow on my level, 'cause I'm raising the stakes
Mom, I made you a promise, it's no more Section 8
And what we ate was the steaks, now our section is great
'Cause that's the level I'm at, my nigga, pass 'em a plate
'Ye!
Why, oh, why, why, why don't they like me?
'Cause Nike gave a lot of niggas checks
But I'm the only nigga to ever check Nike
[Verse 2: Kanye West &
Tyler, The Creator
]
Richer than white people with black kids
Scarier than black people with ideas
Nobody can tell me where I'm headin'
But I feel like Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen at my weddin' (Yeah)
They say I'm crazy, but that's the best thing goin' for me
You can't lynch Marshawn if Tom Brady throwin' to me
I made a million mistakes, but I'm successful in spite of 'em (
Two, three, four
)
I believe you like a fat trainer taking a bite of somethin'
I wanna turn the tanks to playgrounds
I dreamt of 2Pac, he asked me ""Are you still down?""
Yeah, my nigga, it's on, it's on, it's on, it's on
I know they told they white daughters, ""Don't bring home Jerome""
I am the free nigga archetype (Woo)
I am the light and the beacon; you can ask the deacon (Ask the deacon)
It's funny, when you get extra money (
Two, three, four
)
Every joke you tell just be extra funny (Yeah, yeah)
I mean, you can even dress extra bummy
Cocaine, bathroom break, nose extra runny
And I gave you all I got, you still want extra from me
Oxford want a full-blown lecture from me
And the Lexus pull up, errr, like hop, I hopped out, like wassup?
Err-err-err, step back, hold up, my nigga, you suck
Hold up (
Skrrt!
)
I studied the proportions
Emotions runnin' at a Autobahn speed-level
Had a drink with fear, and I was textin' God
He said, ""I gave you a big dick, so go extra hard"", uh (Woo)
For your boy
I'm tryna cop the new McLaren with the vertical doors
I'm watchin'
Freak and Geeks
, got a trampoline in my room
Damn

Saying we up in your house, saying I'm up in your car
But you in LA, and I'm out at Jermaine's
I'm up in the A, you so, so lame
And no one here even mentions your name
It must be the weed, it must be the E
'Cause you be popping, heard you get it popping
Why you so obsessed with me? Boy, I wanna know
Lying that you're sexing me, when everybody knows
It's clear that you're upset with me, oh

Why you wasting your time?
Got you all fired up with your Napoleon complex
See right through you like you're bathing in Windex
You on your job, you hating hard
Ain't gon' feed you, I'ma let you starve
Grasping for air, I'm ventilation
You out of breath, hope you ain't waiting
Telling the world how much you miss me
But we never were, so why you tripping?
You a mom and pop, I'm a corporation
I'm the press conference, you a conversation
Why you so obsessed with me? And boy, I wanna know
Lying that you're sexing me, when everybody knows

Boundaries is my middle name

It's a fight to act like you weren't in mind, or mine
Never want to complain, love you with your wings babe
These are your skies
But then there was the blood from your heart on my hands again
Though I swore I washed it off in the waves
And I wish I was sorry, damn I wish I was sorry
That I don't know how to stay away, stay away
Oh, if only you knew just how you taste
Oh, if only you'd seen you walk away
Oh I'd follow you into yesterday
Then miles away

[Intro]
Stadium status
My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
Who was Hip Hop brother,
who was No I.D. friend
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin
It's the
Hard Knock Life
 Tour, sellout
Picture us in the mall, coppin' Iceberg and yell out ""Jigga""
Yeah, that's what we'll yell out, yell out
You know the name do I gotta spell out or tell 'bout
J-A-Y,
But he got me out my momma crib
Then he help me get my momma a crib
Big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
Who was Hip Hop brother,
who was No I.D. friend
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin, begin
Let the story begin
Fresh off the plane, I'm off to Baseline
'Round the same time of that
Blueprint 1
And these beats in my pocket was that blueprint for him
I'd play my little songs in that old back room
He'd bob his head and say ""Damn! Oh, that's you?""
But by
The Black Album
, I was blacking out
Partyin' S.O.B.'s and we had packed a crowd
Big brother got his show up at Madison Square
And I'm like ""Yeah, yeah, we gon' be there"" but
Not only did I not get a chance to spit it
Carline told me I could buy two tickets
I guess big brother was thinkin' a little different
And kept little brother at bay, at a distance
But everything that I felt was more bogus
Only made me more focused, only wrote more potent
Only thing I wanna know is why I get looked over
I guess I'll understand when I get more older
Big brother saw me at the bottom of the totem
Now I'm on the top and everybody on the scrotum
My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
Who was Hip Hop brother,
who was No I.D. friend
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin, begin
Let the story begin
Not only a client, the Presidito,
hola, Hovito
The game gettin' foul so here's a free throw
Then I dropped ""Jesus Walks"" now I'm on the steeple
And we know, ""New Jack City""—got to keep my brother
On that ""Diamonds"" remix I swore I spazzed
Then my big brother came through and kicked my ass
Sibling rivalry, only I could see
It was the pride in me that was drivin' me
At the Grammys I said, ""I inspired me""
But my big brother who I always tried to be
When I kicked a flow it was like pick-and-roll
'Cause even if he gave me the rock, it's give-and-go
I guess Beanie's style was more of a slam dunk
And my shit was more like a finger roll
I told Jay I did a song with Coldplay
Next thing I know he got a song with Coldplay
Back in my mind I'm like, ""Damn, no way""
Then I went and told Jay Brown
Shoulda known that was gon' come back around
Shoulda talked to you like a man, shoulda told you first
But I told somebody else and that's what made shit worse
My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
So here's a few words from ya kid brother
If you admire somebody you should go on 'head tell 'em
People never get the flowers while they can still smell 'em
A idol in my eyes, god of the game
Heart of the City
Roc-a-Fella chain
My big brother was B.I.G.'s brother
Used to be Dame and Biggs' brother
Who was Hip Hop brother,
who was No I.D. friend
No I.D., my mentor, and that's where the story ends

You can smell it when I'm walkin' down the street

Oh yes, we can, oh yes, we can
)
I can dig rappin', but a rapper with a ghostwriter?
What the fuck happened? (
Oh no!

I swore I wouldn't tell, but most of y'all sharing bars
Like you got the bottom bunk in a two-man cell (

Manipulated Bill Clinton with desires

You goat-mouth mammyfucker
I was gonna kill a couple rappers, but they did it to themselves
Everybody's suicidal, they ain't even need my help
This shit is elementary,
I'll probably go to jail
If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin', ""Compton!""
I should probably run for mayor when I'm done, to be honest
And I put that on my momma and my baby boo too
Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin', woo-woo!
Aw, yeah, fuck the judge
I made it past twenty-five, and there I was
A little nappy-headed nigga with the world behind him
Life ain't shit but a fat vagina
Screamin', ""Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?""
Limo tinted with the gold plates
Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast
From a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king (
Oh yeah

By the time you hear the next pop
The funk shall be within you

Okay, let's handle the small shit
Grew up too quick, went through too much, knew too much shit
Corrupt

Thick and rich, sick and twisted, Mr. Buttersworth
Dre told me to milk this shit for what it's worth
'Til the cow just tilts and tips and stumbles to Earth
And if I fumble a verse, keep goin'
First take I make mistakes, just keep it
No punches pull, no punches, that's weak shit
Fake shit
Wasn't for him, wouldn't be shit
Creep with me as we take a little trip down memory lane
Been here longer than anyone in the game
And I ain't got to lie about my age
But what about Jermaine?
Fuck Jermaine!
He don't belong speakin' mine or Timbaland's name
And don't think I don't read your little interviews and see what you're sayin'
I'm a giant, and I ain't gotta move 'til I'm provoked
When I see you, I'ma step on you and not even know it
You midget, mini-me
with a bunch of little mini-yous
Runnin' around your backyard swimming pools
Over eighty million records sold
And I ain't have to do it with ten- or eleven-year-olds
Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin' it
Just remember how you said it when you was sprayin' it
Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin' it
Just remember how you said it when you was sprayin' it
Second verse, it gets worse, it gets no better than this
Amateurs drink veteran piss
From a Dixie cup
if you ever mix me up
Or confuse me with a Canibus or Dre with a Dupri
We'll rub it in, every club you're in, we'll have you blackballed
And make sure you never rap a-fuckin'-gain
Dre ain't havin' it, long as I'm here to play devil's advocate
If there was some magic shit I could wave
Over the industry that could save it when I'm gone
And buried to make sure the tradition carries on, I would
If I could only use this power for good, I wouldn't, not even if I could
From the hood, and I'm a hornet
And I'ma only sting when I'm cornered
And I'ma only sucker punch and swing without warning
And swing to knock somebody's fuckin' head off
I'm punk rock, no one's punk
Don't give a fuck, white Pac, so much spunk
Attila
And I'm something of a phenom
one puff of the chron'
I'm unstoppable, I'm alive and on top again
There's no obstacle that I can't conquer
So come along with us

Say what you say how you say it whenever you sayin' it
Just remember how you said it when you was sprayin' it

Don't look for trouble, but I'll serve you gourmet
However you want it, you can have it your way
‘Cause this is my space, you invade it
Live to regret it, and you'll die tryna violate it
eyes dilated
Huh, like my old lady?
‘Cause what you say is what you say, sometimes what you mean
Is two different things, depending on your mood if it swings
I speed write and my loose leaf's my launchpad
Talk shit about Dre, you better get a vest and invest in something to protect your head and neck
And it's back and forth all day, like Red and Meth

Nothing is stopping you
Stopping you
Stopping you
Parents always tried to keep me home
What's up, Finally Famous
I had it on my jacket way back in high school
Know I wanted to be in them night clubs and not all off in that night school
every week we did them cyphers
At the radio, had a crazy flow, man the city ain't heard shit like this
I woke up early on a Saturday
Hit the bank, my nigga called me like: ""Go rap for Ye
He at the station, rap that shit that you rap everyday""
Man, that shit sounds stupid
Then I hung up on his ass, then called him back like ""Fuck, let's do it""
I didn't even cash my check, man can't believe my ass pursued it
I didn't even have no gas but somehow God just lead me to it
Like, ""Let's do it""
Man, I knew he had to be on G.O.O.D Music
Cause I had a yellow bone that could've come from out the Simpsons
But fuck it I'm on a mission
Flight delayed like 30 minutes, now that's the shit that I hate
Now it's eight thirty, I'm officially late, for that eight o'clock spot
I know the Program Director hot
But I spit a freestyle up in there so cold
That everybody in that bitch forgot,
Um, alright, it's that young renegade, man they been afraid
Um, I'm like a young black Eminem
It's a riddle and I'm repping that Michigan
Tryna stack my dividends, get my mom a new crib and them
And a bunch of synonyms about how he was living and I even let him finish it
I mean I can't lie he was alright, but at his age, shit so was I
Shorty: Bet, He short as hell though
Hahahaha
But when the world drives you out, and your gas tank is on E
I know you're not my child talking like that.","background vocals pharrell  james fauntleroy

You fuck around, you fuck around, you fuck around, get smoked
Nigga, you fuck around, get smoked
Uh, niggas know the rules in my hood
If you touch me you get murked
We ain't with that back and forth, it ain't no rap, we hittin' first
G-5, we be at LIV by Sunday when you in the church
Momma stressin', sellin' dinner platers
Tryna get your casket and get ya hearse
Every nigga you see with me got ice on 'em, bank rolls on us
Naw nigga, no 1 on 1's, we don't fight fair, we just roll on 'em
V-S stones and Cuban links, all that ice wear with that gold on 'em
We ain't swingin' no flag, nigga
We ain't need no pass, nigga
Glock 40 with a 30 clip and a laser on it, play tag with us
I don't know if y'all heard 'bout what my homie do with that 30 out
Deen Buck still in the cut and the state fittin' to let Ernie out
I ain't even gotta say nothin'
'Bout that other homie that you heard about
Summertime in La Marina with Dominicans goin' in the paint
Pullin' up screamin', ""Eh, Dimelo'?""
Catch you in Brooklyn, get pita-rolled, pussy!
You fuck around get smoked
You fuck around, you fuck around, you fuck around get smoked
Nigga, you fuck around get smoked
(Yeah! Ayy, Meek, whattup? Bang! Oh, man in Chiraq)
Niggas say me and Sosa beefin'
But we both eatin', but only one keepin'
Told Law he take 15 years
Every crime we did we gon Keep It Secret
Can't tweet Teyana, corporate nigga lookin'
So what I’m on I gotta keep it secret
no Mimi, I promise Teyana that I won't leak it
Fuck the judge, let 9 out, hairpin trigger, let 9 out
Four birds in the trap like four wings at Harold’s
With fries covered in mild sauce
Everytime a nigga rap beef, get clapped up in a couple weeks
IG comments and a couple tweets
Location on, we can go and meet
Headshot, I'm outta town, I'm in Killadelphia with my nigga Meek
Pop a wheelie in N-Y-C, I got the 30 on with my nigga Flee
Heard Tyga sneak dissin' on me, tellin thot bitches I'm not right
Tyga only got one name, but that nigga ain't got one stripe
He backpack,
Ask Mally Mall to get his shit back
In Chiraq, don't come here
You ain't from here? Don't come here
No Young Chop, that .40 bangs just like him
Fuck I gotta rap for, got bricks
Every city I go, got sticks
Pockets Wells Fargo, no bricks
L.A. with killas and thuggers
New York SlowBucks, them my brothers
A-T-L with Migos and Young Thugger
Chiraq, look at the murder rate
500 dead bodies, better go and get money 'fore you be on first 48
You wear red bottoms
and Phillip Lim
Hangin’ out the tank with Slow and them
Come take a trip to D.C.
Hear a lot of Me and see GG
I’m the big dog, I’m ringin’ off
Like Mambo Sauce on a 3 piece
“Glizzy, why you ain’t D.C.?""
Who said I ain’t D.C.?
Fuck ya bitch to my CD
She let me record her like Mimi
Ooh, shine got me iced out
Can't wait 'til it get nice out
Tell Chino bring the bikes out

I been ballin'
Could've skipped college
I'm a bad boy with that Big Poppa
Bust his head open like a pinata
Like Percy Miller I've been bout it
Come find your ass like Bin Laden
I kill a clown over my guala
Don't give a fuck if it was 10 dollars
I know these ho's like a pimp scholar
And it's MOB till the day I drop
I whack a bitch and then walk away with blood on my shoes that's red bottoms
I'll pull that bitch out K-9 unit
And kiss your ass goodnight, like, (bang bang) that's smooches
No top that's clueless
I'm ruthless,
I'm ballin' these ho's, yeah, they all on my pool stick
Yeah the game foul and the ref dirty
Keep the green on me like a jets jersey
Keep the 30 on me like I'm Stephen Curry
Now go order up about 20 shirts
RIP with they face on it, had to show they ass how that semi work
Yeah they got smoked April 21st
If I see a opp broad day in public
Then I'm shootin' shit like Azae Production
We gon' ride past with that iron blast
And start flipping niggas like Jessie White
They catching bullets, he Randy Moss, he Terrell Owens, he Jerry Rice
And I'm fucking monster in a pair of Mike's and this 40 on me looks very nice
Hoodie on like a monk, I'm Boyz-N-Tha-Hood with that pump
This bitch got kicked like a punt it usually sit in my trunk
But for today it's riding shotgun since niggas like to front
And if this nigga run and this nigga done, I'ma soak a nigga like he in the tub
These rappers acting like Ice Cube now tell Doughboy to come pick him up
I remember way back when we was broke, we was crying, momma high as hell
To us she was a loving mother but to other motherfuckers she was clientele
Lil Tony got paper now all in my bank account
It's really fucked up in my city I'm sorry but I'm 'bout to add to the body count
I'll Rocky Part 4'em I'm rushin', show all you niggas exactly what I be 'bout
I might come baseline like Kobe Bryant, did way back in '03 and then body yall
Black on black everything
We own black everything
That's the motto when we ridin' out
That money be callin', I won't stop ballin', now I am up next like Jabari now
Show you what I'm saying like closed captions
I'll put the chopper to a nigga top, and then let it fly, Go-Go Gadget
If a fuck nigga ever jump stupid, I'ma catch a body like a trampoline
Bitch I'm Freddy Kruger in a hockey mask
Ask a nigga where he hide his stash
He better tell the truth like a polygraph
Leave a nigga stiff like a body cast
And we don't know nothing about nothing nigga, we was out of town If somebody ask
Iron Man with that metal on him
I'm super fly, put a cape on them
From Chiraq, not Miami, but I'm wearing heat, like I play for them

Crazy, my other show went to my mama 'nem
My daddy said a Mercedes had haunted him
But now he got one, I'm ridin' shotgun
With a three-piece chicken dinner and shotgun

Do you believe that Black man is our sun?
I told Zay I'm the best rapper since twenty-five
Been like that for a while now, I'm twenty-nine

Him and I been around ever since Reagan was criticized
Might stay in the Trump Tower for one week

Dreams pullin' up, I'm like ""skrrt""
I'm livin' my best life
It's my birthday, at least that's what I'm dressed like
I'm like Big Pop' mixed with 2Pac, I'm like Makaveli (Yeah)
You need some, Little Caesar's pizza, I be hot and ready (Woo)
Nigga, you a pussy and a rat, you like Tom and Jerry
Nigga, you ain't ballin', you just talkin', that's that commentary (Huh)
Had to talk to God, dropped down, and prayed for this
To my surprise, He replied, said, ""You made for this""
I seen the car I wanted, then I went and paid for it, cash cash
Hit the Tay-K, I hit the race, hit the dash dash
That's when they came for me on Twitter with the backlash
""#CardiBIsSoProblematic"" is the hashtag
I can't believe they wanna see me lose that bad
They talkin' junk and they stink, these hoes mad trash

153,Pure Comedy,Father John Misty,2017,298185,https://genius.com/Father-John-Misty-Pure-Comedy-lyrics,"At six-
For some reason when I go to the app...
The comedy of man starts like this:
Our brains are way too big for our mothers' hips
And so nature, she devised this alternative:
We emerge half-formed and hope whoever greets us on the other end
Is kind enough to fill us in
And babies, that's pretty much how it's been ever since
Now the miracle of birth leaves a few issues to address
Like, say, that half of us are periodically iron deficient
So somebody's gotta go kill something while I look after the kids
I'd do it myself, but what, are you gonna to get this thing its milk?
He says as soon as he gets back from the hunt, we can switch
It's hard not to fall in love with something so helpless
Ladies, I hope we don't end up regretting this
Comedy, now that's what I call pure comedy
Just wait until the part where they start to believe
They're at the center of everything
And some all-powerful being
Endowed this horror show with meaning
Oh, their religions are the best
They worship themselves yet they're totally obsessed
With risen zombies, celestial virgins, magic tricks
These unbelievable outfits
And they get terribly upset
When you question their sacred texts
Written by woman-hating epileptics
Their languages just serve to confuse them
Their confusion somehow makes them more sure
They build fortunes poisoning their offspring
And hand out prizes when someone patents a cure
Where did they find these goons they elected to rule them?
What makes these clowns they idolize so remarkable?
These mammals are hell-bent on fashioning new gods
So they can go on being godless animals
Oh comedy, their illusions they have no choice but to believe
Their horizons that just forever recede
And how's this for irony:
Their idea of being free is a prison of beliefs
That they never ever have to leave
Oh comedy, oh it's like something that a madman would conceive!
The only thing that seems to make them feel alive
Is the struggle to survive
But the only thing that they request
Is something to numb the pain with
Until there's nothing human left
Just random matter suspended in the dark
I hate to say it, but each other's all we've got","at six

With words that I should have said
As I drown in my regrets
I can't take back the words I never said
I can't take back the words I never said
I really think the War on Terror is a bunch of bullshit
Just a poor excuse for you to use up all your bullets
How much money does it take to really make a full clip?
9/11, building 7, did they really pull it?
Uh, and a bunch of other coverups
If you think that hurts, then wait, here comes the uppercut
The school was garbage in the first place, that's on the up and up
Keep you at the bottom but tease you with the upper crust
If you turn on TV, all you see's a bunch of what-the-fucks
Dude is dating so and so, blabbering 'bout such and such
And that ain't Jersey Shore, homie, that's the news
And these the same people supposedly telling us the truth
Limbaugh is a racist, Glenn Beck is a racist
Gaza Strip was getting bombed, Obama didn't say shit

Complain about the gloom, but when'd you pick a broom up?
Just listening to Pac ain't gon' make it stop
A rebel in your thoughts ain't gon' make it halt
If you don't become a actor, you'll never be a factor
Pills with million side effects, take 'em when the pain's felt
Wash 'em down with diet soda, killing off your brain cells
Crooked banks around the world would gladly give a loan today
So if you ever miss a payment, they can take your home away

I can't take back the words I never said, never said

No comedy skits, just llamas and sticks and drama and shit
This bass to your facе from a speaker make you a twеaker

Hole in one on a par of four or higher, and your supplier
Tour guide for hire, poor guy, he's tired
Cut him some slack, he's strapped, rap to his back
Back to the wall and they all against me

Why I'm not talkin' about wallets and knots

Why, Dad?
Because you came out of my balls, nigga

Hold up, catch a vibe, ain't no way in hell we leavin' nobody alive
Leave a suicide note, fuck that

I'm comin' for your man and his lady and even the baby
I'm feelin' like I'm, chika-chika-chika, Slim Shady with rabies
I'm foamin' at the mouth, ain't nobody takin' me out
And I'm tired of all of this high school ""He's cool, he's not"" rap shit
Can a single one of you motherfuckers even rap? Shit
No, this ain't a diss to the game, this is gas to the flame
Nowadays, everybody sound the same, shit's lame
Like a moth to the flame, I'ma reel 'em in and kill 'em
Know you feelin' lyricism when I'm spillin' it, I'm feelin' myself
Yeah, yeah, Bobby Boy, he be feelin' himself
Mass murder like this can't be good for my health

But if you ain't comin' with the illest of raps
Callin' yourself the greatest alive

You gon' make Bobby Boy snap

Jigga-jigga-jigga-jigga-jigga like JAY-Z
Jig is up, you fuckers who didn't write anything
Are getting washed, liga-liga-liga, like bathing
Young Hova, I know hitters like Yankees
Gun toters that pull triggers like crazy
Unloadin', leave you shot up in your Rover
Your body goes limp and slumps over
Like A-Rod in a month lull, but he just homered
Hol' up, I said ""Rover"" because now your Rover is red
Like Red Rover, so you know what I meant
But I roll over my opponents instead
Makin' dog sounds 'cause I gotta keep breakin' these bars down
I'll go slow for the speds
But when I go (Roof!) like the Dobermann said
I still think the (Roof!) would go over your head (Ha-ha)
Beast mode, motherfuckers 'bout to get hit
With so many foul lines, you'll think I'm a free throw
Figured it was about time for people to eat crow
You about to get out-rhymed, how could I be dethroned?
I stay on my toes like the repo, a behemoth in sheep's clothes
From the East Coast to the West, I'm the ethos and I'm the GOAT
Who the best, I don't gotta say a fuckin' thing, though
'Cause MCs know
But you don't wanna hear me spit the facts
Your shit is ass like a tailbone
Or you're trapped in your cell phone
Or my chicken scratch, or my self-loathe
I don't wanna fuckin' listen to you spit your raps someone else wrote
Used to get beat up by the big kids
Used to let the big kids steal my big wheel
And I wouldn't do shit but just sit still
Now money's not a big deal
I'm rich, I wipe my ass with six mill'
Big bills like a platypus
A caterpillar's comin' to get the cannabis
Man, I can see my dick is standin' stiff as a mannequin
And I'm bringin' the bandana back, and the fuckin' headband again
A handkerchief and I'm thinkin' of bringin' the fuckin' fingerless gloves back
And not giving a singular fuck, like fuck rap
I sound like a fuckin' millionaire
With a Derringer with a hair trigger
'Bout to bear hug a fuckin' terrier, the Ric Flair dripper
Y'all couldn't hold a candle at a prayer vigil
When I vent, they compare me to a fuckin' air duct
The track is the blood, I'm attracted, I'm attackin' it
What? Dracula, fuck that shit
Man, stop
Look what I'm plannin', plannin', I'm plannin' to
Do all this while ya panickin'
And you're lookin' and starin' at mannequins
And I'm goin' to Fanagans
Trying to get up a plan against
All of the blana-kazana-ka-fam-bam-bannigans
While of all the bana-kazanika Hanna in a cabana
You're in a cab-
I'm in a cabana and a Janet
I'm in a cabana chantin' all this standup banter
While you don't got the stamina, you're lackin' the stamina
You're lackin' the stamina while you're divorcin' Harrison Ford
And I'm in a Porsche on the floorboards
While I'm world tourin'
You usin' way too many napkins, papkins
Lapkins and chapki-
You using ChapStick and napkins while I'm bapkin'
Flappin' around like a bapkin'

I pray to God my plug got pour up

It's hard for me to drive, I move too slow
My brother got a chopper and it's kickin' like Judo
The moon rock on me, I love the aroma
She love the coke, but not Coca-Cola
Her name rings bells like a Motorola

We go back to your house
You check the charts
And start to figure it out
And if it's crowded, all the better
Because we know we're gonna be up late
But if you're worried about the weather
Then you picked the wrong place to stay
That's how it starts
And so it starts
You switch the engine on
We set controls for the heart of the sun
One of the ways that we show our age
And if the sun comes up, if the sun comes up
If the sun comes up and I still don't wanna stagger home
Then it's the memory of our betters
That are keeping us on our feet
You spent the first five years trying to get with the plan
And the next five years trying to be with your friends again
Oh, you're talking forty-five turns just as fast as you can
Yeah, I know it gets tired, but it's better when we pretend
It comes apart
The way it does in bad films
Though when we're running out of the drugs
And the conversation's grinding away
I wouldn't trade one stupid decision
For another five years of life
you drop the first ten years just as fast as you can
And the next ten people who are trying to be polite
When you're blowing eighty-five days in the middle of France
Yeah, I know it gets tired, only where are your friends tonight?
And to tell the truth
Oh, this could be the last time
So here we go
Like a sales force into the night
And if I made a fool, if I made a fool
If I made a fool on the road, there's always this
And if I'm sued into submission
I can still come home to this
And with a face like a dad and a laughable stand
You can sleep on the plane or review what you said
When you're drunk and the kids look impossibly tanned
You think over and over, ""Hey, I'm finally dead""
Oh, if the trip and the plan come apart in your hand
You can turn it on yourself, you ridiculous clown
You'll forget what you meant when you read what you said
And yeah, we knew you were tired, but then
Where are your friends tonight?
Where are your friends tonight?
Where are your friends tonight?

I know you want to cry all night, all night
Plottin', schemin', findin'
Reason to defend all of your violent nights
Promise me you will see
Don't you grow up in a hurry, your mom'll be worried, aw
It was all part of the story, even the scary nights
Thank you for all of the glory, you will be remembered, aw
Thank you to all of the heroes of the night (Night, night)
They gotta repaint the colors, the lie is wearin' off
Reality is upon us, colors drippin' off
Colors drippin' off
Niggas is savage, niggas is monsters
Niggas is pimps, niggas is players
'Til niggas have daughters, now they precautious
Father, forgive me, I'm scared of the karma
'Cause now I see women as somethin' to nurture
Not somethin' to conquer
I hope she like Nicki, I make her a monster
Not havin' ménages, I'm just bein' silly
I answered the door like Will Smith and Martin
Nigga, do we have a problem?
Matter fact, Marlon, this ain't
Meet the Fockers
I'll beat his ass, pray I beat the charges
No, Daddy don't play, not when it come to they daughters
Don't do no yoga, don't do pilates
Just play piano and stick to karate
I pray your body's draped more like mine
And not like your mommy's
Just bein' salty, but niggas is nuts
And I am a nigga, I know what they want
I pray that you don't get it all at once
Curves under your dress, I know it's pervs all on the net
All in the comments, you wanna vomit
That's your baby, you love her to death
If you whoop her ass, she move in with him
Then he whoop her ass, you go through it again
But how you the devil rebukin' the sin?
Let's pray we can put this behind us
I swear that these times is the wildest
She got the scars, they serve as reminders
Blood still on her pajamas
But yesterday is dead, yeah, moment of silence
Next, she'll be off to college and then at the altar

I wanna tell my pops but, shit, he'll probably say the same

Hated by everyone, that's the way it seems
I don't know what's shorter, his damn temper or my self-esteem

My best friend's an inhaler because it will not let me cough
Whenever I am losing oxygen, bully hand around my neck
'Cause he felt disrespected when I decided to talk again
I brought that on myself, see, I should know my place
But not at lunchtime, see, I know better than to show my face
Around them, but the day I do, it'll be everywhere
When I share these feelings finally, they gon' fucking care

Grab a couple friends, start a couple riots
Crash a couple (Planes, planes, planes)

Just know if you start acting, I'm grabbing for these trench coats!

I'll show him a fag, and I'll light a fire up in his ass
And recently, them assholes been fucking with me in class
So I'ma keep them motherfuckers there and make sure they pass, huh
My prom date, she dismissed my offer
So I'ma **** her and toss her in the principal's office

Oh, now you wanna conversate with me, try to be my friend?

We are the Sams, and we're dead—it's just four of us
We come in peace, we mean no harm, and we're inglorious
We took their heads, but we just took back what they took from us
I guess we lost ours...
Music had nothing to do with my final decision
I just really wanted somebody to come pay me attention
But nobody would listen but stuffed animals that I had
Since I was a kid, but I'm growing up, so they're missing
I didn't mean to hurt anybody, I'm sorry
I wouldn't hurt a fly or consider joining the Army
I'm hardly ever angry, Roger Rabbit framed me
Mama, I'm the same fucking kid that you made, see?
I don't wanna go to jail, I just wanna go home
And I want them fucking kids at school to just leave me alone
I'm fucking reloaded, I told you all that I ain't taking shit

Back, back, way back I used to front like Angkor Wat
Mechanicsburg,
Anchorage

While home in New York was champagne and disco
Tapes from L.A. slash San Francisco
But actually Oakland and not Alameda
Your girl was in Berkeley with her Communist reader
Mine was entombed within boombox and Walkman
I was a hoarder, but girl, that was back then
The gloves are off,

She's richer than Croesus,

I just ignore all the tales of her past life
Stale conversation deserves but a bread knife

On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh

184,Episode 6: The Case Against Adnan Syed,Serial Podcast,2014,255428,https://genius.com/Serial-Podcast-Episode-6-The-Case-Against-Adnan-Syed-lyrics,"So, it’s just, it’s a really tight, really window of time I mean, for this to have taken place, right?
Isn’t that sort of tantamount to saying ‘I think Jay’s telling the truth?’
Leakin
The most incriminating piece of physical evidence against Adnan Syed was a fingerprint
, or rather, a palm print.
It was one of those big map books you buy at a gas station, police found it in the backseat of Hae’s car. On the back cover was a partial print of Adnan’s left palm.
At trial they pointed out that it was the page that showed Leakin Park.
The defense argued, ‘well, you can’t put a timestamp on fingerprints, they could’ve been six week-old fingerprints or six month-old fingerprints, there’s no way to tell.’ And Adnan had ridden in and driven Hae’s car many times, all their friends said
so.
The ripped out page showed a whole lot more than just Leakin Park. In fact, it showed their whole neighborhood, the school, the malls, probably ninety percent of where they most often drove. And that page didn’t have Adnan’s prints on it.
His palm print was only on the back cover of the book. Plus, thirteen other, unidentified prints turned up on and in the map book. None of them matched Adnan, or Jay. So, the prints weren’t exactly conclusive.
Over the past few weeks, I’ve been holding up bits of evidence here and there that look bad for Adnan. Today, I’m just going to lay out the rest.
Everything else that a person could reasonably add to the ‘Adnan is guilty’ side of the scale.
Some of these I have mentioned before but, let’s just hang them all up, side-by-side, and see what they look like.
First off, there’s a question of whether Adnan asked Hae for a ride that day after school. Was he looking for an excuse to get in her car, so he could kill her.
Adnan told him he’d asked her for a ride
Then, you know how Adnan says he can’t remember much at all about the day Hae went missing? How it was just a normal day to him, nothing much stands out? I’ve wondered about that.
wouldn’t the call from Officer Adcock asking, whether he’s seen Hae just in and of itself, wouldn’t that call make it a not normal day?
call! [Calling to] say, “
Adnan Syed
Oh no, uh, I do remember that phone call and I do remember being high at the time because the craziest thing is to be high and have the police call your phone. I’ll never forget that.
I guess that’s the only thing about the day that seems weird to me that you wouldn’t then, that the day wouldn’t then come into focus for you because you’d gotten this call from the cops and you know, you, you were high, you were young, you know, it’s a - it’s a scary call to get or just a just a jarring call to get.
If the police are at her house, you know, if her mother, actually, you know for, for whatever reason, if she didn’t, you know she didn’t go home or she went somewhere else. In no way did I associate this call with being, you know, umm the beginning of you know, of this whole horrible thing.
to me, all this call was, Hae’s going to get in a lot you trouble
you know, her mother is going to be pissed when she comes home, right.
To be fair to Adnan, if this really was his reaction, then he wasn’t the only one. The seriousness of Hae’s disappearance didn’t start sinking in with her friends for a while.
School was cancelled on January 14th and 15th because of the ice storm, then the weekend came
Then Monday was Martin Luther King Day, so the kids didn’t all reconvene at school until the following Tuesday.
All of Hae’s friends I spoke to said they initially thought Hae had either run off someplace with her new boyfriend Don or, this was another rumor
that she’d run off to California. Friends said she talked about that sometimes, that her dad, or maybe it was her step dad, was in California, and she wanted to go there.
Next, the night before Hae disappeared, Adnan called her house three times. Seems like the only time they actually spoke was the third call, at 12:35am.
neither Hae’s home number nor her pager shows up again, which suggests he never tried to contact her after she went missing
They were supposedly such good friends.
Well, I know that we would always, I-I can’t remember if I did page her or not but, we would always talk about it at school. I would always like get my information first hand from like Aisha who would usually be in contact with obvi-, if I can remember she was like in contact with Hae’s family. So it was kind of like I would always, if not Aisha or Krista or or or it I mean  it wasn’t like I was just sittin’ around, like not even thinking about her. You know, not paging her or whatever, but I used to always get my information from them first hand, you know, it-it’s not it- I don’t remember if I ever paged her or not.
You know, it just seems that, I know Krista was trying to page her, I know Aisha was trying to page her, during this time to just be like ‘where are you, where are you, where are you?’ And I was wondering if you had- were in the group of like ‘where are you?’
(long pause)
What, are you asking me a question?
is that it seems like your relationship you had with her, you would have been one of those people saying, ‘hey, hey, hey like give a holler, where are you okay, we’re all worried about you.’
No! It does not mean I’m not right alongside with them. It’s not like they’re in a hole, I mean, we’re all seeing each other everyday, we’re talking about it. It’s not like you know, it’s not like I’m just sitting there like whenever Hae comes up in a conversation I’m leaving, going to another side of the classroom or something like that. I mean, I’m just as involved as they are, yeah so, I mean, I don’t
you know.
Then, there are some stray things. That, eh, I don’t know what they mean.
Or if they mean much of anything
But I’m going to tell you about them in case
“I’m really getting annoyed that this situation is going the way it is” she wrote, “you know, people break up all the time. Your life is not going to end. You’ll move on and I’ll move on. But apparently you don’t respect me enough to accept my decision.”
Aisha Pittman read this note at trial, Hae was her best friend. Adnan had shown Aisha the letter, apparently in health class. And they had written notes to each other on the back. Aisha in pencil, Adnan in pen.
They were joking, making fun of Hae, making fun of themselves, it’s all just silliness
But then, at the top of the page it says, “I’m going to kill.” In pen.
The note just seems like you guys are just messing around.
So that wasn’t on the note when I was writing with it. So for, to see it later, it was one of those things where it’s like, that’s weird to see that but, I don’t know when that would have been written or what the--
I don’t-- no, because when I am first seeing that part of it, it was sitting in court having to read the rest of the letter.
Police had found the note when they searched Adnan’s house. But, who knows about that one, right? Seems like a detail you’d find in a cheesey detective novel.
“My daughter just heard something about a dead body.” Dave told the cops, “It was the neighbor boy who mentioned it.” Dave names the neighbor boy but, I’m just going to call him The Neighbor Boy. Here’s Dave…
He was, he was, with a friend and the friend said something like, ‘look what I have’ and he popped the trunk and that’s what he saw.
Did he seem upset or..?
     Laura
     He seemed disturbed. More like a ‘wow, I can’t believe what I just saw.’ Kinda almost like he was maybe getting something off his chest, that type of thing.
I asked Laura, did The Neighbor Boy tell you the name of this friend that showed him the body?
I think the guy’s name was maybe Adnan?
Really?
Hm. So this guy said, ‘my friend Adnan showed me the body of a girl in the back of a car?’
Umm-hmm. Yes.
Do you think he was telling the truth?
Yes
Laura didn’t go to Woodlawn. She didn’t know Adnan, she’d known The Neighbor Boy since they were little, they were friendly
she never spoke to police about this, they never questioned her.
So this sounds really really bad, right? That there was another witness, besides Jay, who saw Hae’s body, who saw Adnan with Hae’s body. That’s huge.
he is now somebody else’s neighbor and he’s a man
He was affable and patient and he wholly denied this episode. He was pretty convincing. He said quote, “the only dead body I’ve seen was on TV. God’s honest truth. Except for my great-grandmother. She died when I was like nine.” The Neighbor Man said that he wasn’t friends with Adnan.
I wouldn’t kid around about something like that.”
This is what’s weird.
That original police report about Dave and his daughter Laura, it’s dated April 28th. By that time, Adnan had already been in jail for nearly two months. But Laura was under the impression that what happened to her neighbor had just happened. She told her dad right away, and he called the cops right away. And, I talked to friends of Jay’s who also knew The Neighbor Boy, and they said, “oh that guy?” They gave the impression The Neighbor Boy was a bit of a gossip. A guy untalented at keeping secrets
Which, could play either way I guess. But they meant it like, “nobody would tell him anything they wanted to stay quiet.”
And if Laura’s story is true, then there’s another witness to this murder
It’s one of the things about this case that kind of bobs above the water for me, like a disturbing buoy.
Cathy
So, after Hae had been killed, but before they went to bury her body. It was about six o’clock at night.
She knew Jay a little bit, but only through Jenn. She didn’t know Adnan at all. So, here was an acquaintance, Jay, and a stranger, who suddenly show up at her door.
and I was kinda surprised and a little confused because he didn’t call me unless he was with Jenn and nobody had called to say “hey are you guys home? Do you guys want to hang out?” Nothing like that. So it was a little strange that he would just pop up at the door. I remember him being like, “do you want to smoke? Do you wanna hang out?” And I remember being like, “well hang on a second,” and asking Jeff if he wanted to-- “Jay’s at the door!” Jeff was like, “for what?” “Well he wants to hang out.” And Jeff was like, “that’s cool.” So Jay came in and he introduced his friend, I don’t think he introduced him by name, I think he was just like, “this is a friend of mine.”
Cathy remembers Jay sat over by the table and Adnan settled on the floor on some big cushions that were there, and didn’t speak.
Cathy
doing
amidst all my cushions
who is this guy
This is a girl who says some kid she didn’t know who was high was acting strangely in her living room.
I’ve been that girl for Christ sakes.
Having to deal with some stoned friend of a friend on the living room floor. And I’ve probably been that wierd guy on the floor at least once. But, listening to Cathy tell it, all these years later, the way it stuck with her, how she describes the whole night as just feeling wrong, that also made it stick with me.
Cathy thought Jay was acting odd as well
She knew him as this super laid back stoner guy, like Shaggy from Scooby-Doo.
But now he was being conspicuously chatty.
“How was your day?” “What’s going on?” Kinda-- dominated the conversation really.
Jay and Adnan were there, Jenn called the apartment
The story Cathy is telling is pretty close to what she told the cops during the investigation
“how do I get rid of a high?”
Cathy
--and he asked “how do I get rid of a high? I have to meet someone or do something and it’s really important.” And I was like, “you just have to let it-- just have to let it go.”
No, he didn’t-- I’m not clear whether I remembered him saying “I have to go talk to someone” or “I have to go meet someone” or “I have to go do something.” I’m not sure he-- I remember him expressing it was really important what he had to go do. He didn’t specify what.
There are three incoming calls on the call log that ping towers near Cathy’s house.
6:07, 6:09, and 6:24 p.m
And Hae’s brother, Young,
one phone call
She says, they’re sitting around talking, when one of Cathy’s favorite shows is on the TV, Judge Judy.
“what am I going to do? What am I gonna say? They’re gonna come talk to me. What am I supposed to say?”
And I remember him sounding very worried-- concerned. This was-- whatever was happening was not good on the other line. I remember being like, “wow, I wonder what he’s going--” eavesdropping basically! Wondering what was going on. Not too long after he hung up the phone, he left. Just bust out the door, left.
Jay follows Adnan out, leaves his hat and smokes behind,
Cathy
     And so now they’re outside in a car and I remember going to the window, “what are they doing? Jeff, they’re in the car, they’re just sitting there. What the hell is going on?” Just finding the whole situation super odd, super strange. And Jeff, he just didn’t give a shit about anything. “Eh, it doesn’t matter, who cares? You know?” I just remember being like, “what is going on?”
Was it--you’d never met the other guy before, Adnan, right? So you didn’t know what was normal behavior for him?
clearly it was not normal behavior for anybody
Clearly you could tell something was going on, something was going on [that] wasn’t good, and yeah, it was just strange behavior for anybody.
think that’s been the one thing I’ve always remembered. Like how he said it, how he looked, when he said it
He’s definitely panicked. He’s definitely worried
and
I could imagine if I was in a position that’s what I would’ve been saying on the phone to my best friend. You know, “my god, what am I gonna do? They’re gonna come talk to me. What am I supposed to say?” You know, trying to come up with some story quickly.
“oh, it’s nothing.”
I didn’t get a full account.
The next time I talked to Adnan, I told him how Cathy still remembered all this stuff, how shady the whole scene was for her. And he said that on a bunch of levels, what Cathy had to say didn’t hold much water with him. First of all, if someone had called him to warn him the police were about to call, why would he then answer the phone when the police called?
I mean, if I was expecting the police to call me I probably wouldn’t have answered my phone then.
(long pause)
But then it still leaves us with the third person. This third individual--
So now who was this third person on the phone? So, at some point, her memory either benefits me or it doesn’t benefit me.
Her testimony does not look good for you, you know. Because she’s not really connected to Jay, she’s not connected to you, you know she’s a little bit more objective I would say, and she really thought you were acting, very strangely. You know. So it didn’t-- it’s not good for you, what she has to say. (clears throat)
Adnan Syed
don’t
Like I seriously doubt she would have gave this a second thought had I never been charged with Hae’s murder.
he didn’t identify himself
she assumed it was Adnan
Westview Mall, she says she saw them arrive in Adnan’s car.
n the Adnan side, that detail has always stuck with me too. That Jenn says Adnan seemed so normal
The thing about Jenn and Cathy though, is that even though they don’t look great for Adnan, they don’t actually contradict Adnan’s own account of that evening.
Which, I think, is why he kind of shrugs them off. And why I’m sometimes tempted to shrug them off.
Because Adnan has always admitted he was hanging out with Jay that night.
So, so what if a couple of people saw them together? What does that prove?
But, now we come to the big one
It’s the Nisha call.
Think of it as a title, capitalized, The Nisha Call
Nisha
Adnan
Silver Spring
I don’t. And… uh I have no idea why he would call and their
Nisha
For a smoking gun, she is very cute, she looks like a chipmunk.
Thank you.
Ummm, it’s a little hard to recall, but I remember him telling me that Jay invite- invited him over to a video store that he worked at. And, he basically well Adnan walked in with his cell phone and then like- he told me to speak with Jay and I was like ‘okay’ cause Jay wanted to say hi so I said hi to Jay. And that’s all I can really recall.
Kevin Urick
Now if I had to guess, I’d say that the prosecutor is trying to get her to not mention the video store, because it contradicts their story.
hen she goes on. She doesn’t mention the video store to Urick again
But still, if Adnan is supposedly at school  during this time, and Jay is not talking to Nisha for two minutes and twenty-two seconds, then who the hell is calling Nisha?
This is what Adnan can’t explain.
You can see he calls her a lot on his cell.
very first number he dials
But if she-- she says she testifies that her phone does not have an answering machine or voicemail on it. So who is picking up that call and talking for two and a half minutes or whatever it was? Two minutes and twenty-two seconds or some--
--cause I’m almost sure I remember-- I’m sure I remember her phone having an answering machine or voicemail, or something--
I for sure a thousand percent say I was not in the car with him at that time or did I have access to the phone at that time, because I was at school that day.
I’ve swiveled the Rubik’s Cube of this case so many different ways. I’ve arranged and rearranged it to come up with alternate versions of how this day might have actually gone
And I can get pretty far in certain hypothetical directions.
Jay’s got the car, Jay’s got the phone, all these calls are to his friends
And then I remember the Nisha call, and the whole thing crumbles.
The Nisha call is a big, fat problem for Adnan
Adnan says his biggest fear is not being believed. When he’s sure about something, he has a tendency to over explain, to inundate you with facts and information, and then corroboration for the facts and information.
Adnan Syed
     Anyone who knows me will say I kinda go overboard to the point where people will be like, “alright man, we believe you.” It could be about anything, it could be about whether it rained yesterday, because in my mind it’s something-- it’s a personality quirk born of all this. I mean I really-- I don’t like to talk about things if I can prove-- no matter how silly it is.
Sarah Koenig
He does it with anything. He’s a cook at the prison, and he said he got into a discussion with some guys recently about barbecue sauce. Adnan was saying if you don’t have molasses or brown sugar you can substitute pancake syrup, and the guys were like, “nah, no way.” And so at breakfast, Adnan made a little batch of barbecue sauce using pancake syrup.
Nobody needs barbecue sauce at breakfast time, at the maximum security prison in Cumberland, Maryland. But he did it anyway.
All these things that look bad for Adnan, everything that’s raised my suspicion, even stupid things, I’ve run every single one of them by him. I’ve got this thing in my head that I’ll catch him in a lie. Maybe just a tiny, meaningless lie, and that’s going to be his tell, and he’ll be caught.
and then I don’t believe him?
That notion, that people out there in the world, people he went to school with, who knew him, don’t believe him, that they can imagine he is capable of killing Hae, Adnan spent fifteen years thinking about that. And then trying not to think about that.
or if there was like-- Hae fought back and there was all this stuff of me, like DNA, like scratches,
That used to really devastate me, kind of. You know what I’m saying? That used to just really, really just strike me to my core. And uh--
     Sarah Koenig
     Just like, “what is it about me that would allow someone to even entertain the possibility that I could do this?” Is that the thing?
They saying that I plotted and planned and kept my true intentions hidden, I mean just some real devious, cruel, like Hitler type stuff. You know what I mean? Just some real some like cruel, cruel like inhuman type stuff. Like, “wow man!” you know what I mean? I obviously-- I’m not saying that I was a great person or anything, but I don’t think I ever displayed any tendencies like that--
-where a person would think that you know-- I mean maybe, who knows, maybe if it would have happened to someone else, I would have believed it just because I naturally would have assumed that, well if the police got the right guy, they got him for the right reasons.
What the hell does that even mean?
No! They don’t! No they-- not everyone has the ability to do something cruel and heinous like this
him
I thought I didn’t care about this too much, but obviously I probably do.
Well, because, you know, it-you know, it kinda doesn’t really matter what people think, you know what I’m saying? It doesn’t uh- I shouldn’t care.
But then, I see many problems with Adnan’s story too. And so I start to doubt him, I talk to him and talk to him, and I start to doubt my doubts
And then I worry that I’m a sucker that I don’t know.
That’s the cycle
But I also told him really what really hooked me most, was him. Just trying to figure out, who is this person who says he didn’t kill this girl but is serving a life sentence for killing this girl.
My interest in it honestly has been you, like you’re a really nice guy. Like I like talking to you, you know, so then it’s kind of like this question of well, what does that mean? You know.
I mean, you don’t even really know me though uh Koenig.
I’m, you don’t. I- I- maybe you do. Maybe, I don’t- we only talk on the phone, I don’t understand
But wait, are you saying you don’t think that I know you at all?!
I mean for you to say that I’m a great person. I mean, like a nice person, then you know what I’m saying? That- I- I-don’t know I’ve only talked to you on the phone a few times. I don’t,  I mean I guess you investigated me back then.
And so, I was a little bit like taken aback, and I still like I guess feel a little taken aback that like… what do you think I don’t know? About you.
To be honest with you, it kinda- I feel like I want to shoot myself, if I hear someone else say, I don’t think he did it cause you’re a nice guy, Adnan.
I would rather someone say, Adnan, I think you’re a jerk, you’re selfish, you know, you’re a crazy SOB, you should just stay in there for the rest of your life except that I looked at your case and it looks, you know, like a little off.
I understand this, being a nice guy doesn’t count as exculpatory evidence. And if I’m going to spend a year figuring out that he’s a nice guy, I might as well piss off. Point taken.
Maybe, we need some experts on this job.
Next time, on Serial.","so it is just it is a really tight really window of time i mean for this to have taken place right
is not that sort of tantamount to saying i think jays telling the truth
leakin
the most incriminating piece of physical evidence against adnan syed was a fingerprint
 or rather a palm print
it was one of those big map books you buy at a gas station police found it in the backseat of haes car on the back cover was a partial print of adnans left palm
at trial they pointed out that it was the page that showed leakin park
the defense argued well you cannot put a timestamp on fingerprints they could have been six weekold fingerprints or six monthold fingerprints there is no way to tell and adnan had ridden in and driven haes car many times all their friends said
so
the ripped out page showed a whole lot more than just leakin park in fact it showed their whole neighborhood the school the malls probably ninety percent of where they most often drove and that page did not have adnans prints on it
his palm print was only on the back cover of the book plus thirteen other unidentified prints turned up on and in the map book none of them matched adnan or jay so the prints were not exactly conclusive
over the past few weeks i have been holding up bits of evidence here and there that look bad for adnan today i am just going to lay out the rest
everything else that a person could reasonably add to the adnan is guilty side of the scale
some of these i have mentioned before but let us just hang them all up sidebyside and see what they look like
first off there is a question of whether adnan asked hae for a ride that day after school was he looking for an excuse to get in her car so he could kill her
adnan told him he would asked her for a ride
then you know how adnan says he cannot remember much at all about the day hae went missing how it was just a normal day to him nothing much stands out i have wondered about that
would not the call from officer adcock asking whether he is seen hae just in and of itself would not that call make it a not normal day
call calling to say 
adnan syed
oh no uh i do remember that phone call and i do remember being high at the time because the craziest thing is to be high and have the police call your phone i will never forget that
i guess that is the only thing about the day that seems weird to me that you would not then that the day would not then come into focus for you because you would gotten this call from the cops and you know you you were high you were young you know it is a  it is a scary call to get or just a just a jarring call to get
if the police are at her house you know if her mother actually you know for for whatever reason if she did not you know she did not go home or she went somewhere else in no way did i associate this call with being you know umm the beginning of you know of this whole horrible thing
to me all this call was haes going to get in a lot you trouble
you know her mother is going to be pissed when she comes home right
to be fair to adnan if this really was his reaction then he was not the only one the seriousness of haes disappearance did not start sinking in with her friends for a while
school was cancelled on january th and th because of the ice storm then the weekend came
then monday was martin luther king day so the kids did not all reconvene at school until the following tuesday
all of haes friends i spoke to said they initially thought hae had either run off someplace with her new boyfriend don or this was another rumor
that she would run off to california friends said she talked about that sometimes that her dad or maybe it was her step dad was in california and she wanted to go there
next the night before hae disappeared adnan called her house three times seems like the only time they actually spoke was the third call at am
neither haes home number nor her pager shows up again which suggests he never tried to contact her after she went missing
they were supposedly such good friends
well i know that we would always ii cannot remember if i did page her or not but we would always talk about it at school i would always like get my information first hand from like aisha who would usually be in contact with obvi if i can remember she was like in contact with haes family so it was kind of like i would always if not aisha or krista or or or it i mean  it was not like i was just sittin around like not even thinking about her you know not paging her or whatever but i used to always get my information from them first hand you know itit is not it i do not remember if i ever paged her or not
you know it just seems that i know krista was trying to page her i know aisha was trying to page her during this time to just be like where are you where are you where are you and i was wondering if you had were in the group of like where are you
long pause
what are you asking me a question
is that it seems like your relationship you had with her you would have been one of those people saying hey hey hey like give a holler where are you okay we are all worried about you
no it does not mean i am not right alongside with them it is not like they are in a hole i mean we are all seeing each other everyday we are talking about it it is not like you know it is not like i am just sitting there like whenever hae comes up in a conversation i am leaving going to another side of the classroom or something like that i mean i am just as involved as they are yeah so i mean i do not
you know
then there are some stray things that eh i do not know what they mean
or if they mean much of anything
but i am going to tell you about them in case
i am really getting annoyed that this situation is going the way it is she wrote you know people break up all the time your life is not going to end you will move on and i will move on but apparently you do not respect me enough to accept my decision
aisha pittman read this note at trial hae was her best friend adnan had shown aisha the letter apparently in health class and they had written notes to each other on the back aisha in pencil adnan in pen
they were joking making fun of hae making fun of themselves it is all just silliness
but then at the top of the page it says i am going to kill in pen
the note just seems like you guys are just messing around
so that was not on the note when i was writing with it so for to see it later it was one of those things where it is like that is weird to see that but i do not know when that would have been written or what the
i do not no because when i am first seeing that part of it it was sitting in court having to read the rest of the letter
police had found the note when they searched adnans house but who knows about that one right seems like a detail you would find in a cheesey detective novel
my daughter just heard something about a dead body dave told the cops it was the neighbor boy who mentioned it dave names the neighbor boy but i am just going to call him the neighbor boy here is dave
he was he was with a friend and the friend said something like look what i have and he popped the trunk and that is what he saw
did he seem upset or
     laura
     he seemed disturbed more like a wow i cannot believe what i just saw kind of almost like he was maybe getting something off his chest that type of thing
i asked laura did the neighbor boy tell you the name of this friend that showed him the body
i think the guys name was maybe adnan
really
hm so this guy said my friend adnan showed me the body of a girl in the back of a car
ummhmm yes
do you think he was telling the truth
yes
laura did not go to woodlawn she did not know adnan she would known the neighbor boy since they were little they were friendly
she never spoke to police about this they never questioned her
so this sounds really really bad right that there was another witness besides jay who saw haes body who saw adnan with haes body that is huge
he is now somebody elses neighbor and he is a man
he was affable and patient and he wholly denied this episode he was pretty convincing he said quote the only dead body i have seen was on tv gods honest truth except for my greatgrandmother she died when i was like nine the neighbor man said that he was not friends with adnan
i would not kid around about something like that
this is what is weird
that original police report about dave and his daughter laura it is dated april th by that time adnan had already been in jail for nearly two months but laura was under the impression that what happened to her neighbor had just happened she told her dad right away and he called the cops right away and i talked to friends of jays who also knew the neighbor boy and they said oh that guy they gave the impression the neighbor boy was a bit of a gossip a guy untalented at keeping secrets

and if lauras story is true then there is another witness to this murder
it is one of the things about this case that kind of bobs above the water for me like a disturbing buoy
cathy
so after hae had been killed but before they went to bury her body it was about six of the clock at night
she knew jay a little bit but only through jenn she did not know adnan at all so here was an acquaintance jay and a stranger who suddenly show up at her door
and i was kind of surprised and a little confused because he did not call me unless he was with jenn and nobody had called to say hey are you guys home do you guys want to hang out nothing like that so it was a little strange that he would just pop up at the door i remember him being like do you want to smoke do you want to hang out and i remember being like well hang on a second and asking jeff if he wanted to jays at the door jeff was like for what well he wants to hang out and jeff was like that is cool so jay came in and he introduced his friend i do not think he introduced him by name i think he was just like this is a friend of mine
cathy remembers jay sat over by the table and adnan settled on the floor on some big cushions that were there and did not speak
cathy
doing
amidst all my cushions
who is this guy
this is a girl who says some kid she did not know who was high was acting strangely in her living room
i have been that girl for christ sakes
having to deal with some stoned friend of a friend on the living room floor and i have probably been that wierd guy on the floor at least once but listening to cathy tell it all these years later the way it stuck with her how she describes the whole night as just feeling wrong that also made it stick with me
cathy thought jay was acting odd as well
she knew him as this super laid back stoner guy like shaggy from scoobydoo
but now he was being conspicuously chatty
how was your day what is going on kind of dominated the conversation really
jay and adnan were there jenn called the apartment
the story cathy is telling is pretty close to what she told the cops during the investigation
how do i get rid of a high
cathy
and he asked how do i get rid of a high i have to meet someone or do something and it is really important and i was like you just have to let it just have to let it go
no he did not i am not clear whether i remembered him saying i have to go talk to someone or i have to go meet someone or i have to go do something i am not sure he i remember him expressing it was really important what he had to go do he did not specify what
there are three incoming calls on the call log that ping towers near cathys house
  and  pm
and haes brother young
one phone call
she says they are sitting around talking when one of cathys favorite shows is on the tv judge judy
what am i going to do what am i going to say they are going to come talk to me what am i supposed to say
and i remember him sounding very worried concerned this was whatever was happening was not good on the other line i remember being like wow i wonder what he is going eavesdropping basically wondering what was going on not too long after he hung up the phone he left just bust out the door left
jay follows adnan out leaves his hat and smokes behind
cathy
     and so now they are outside in a car and i remember going to the window what are they doing jeff they are in the car they are just sitting there what the hell is going on just finding the whole situation super odd super strange and jeff he just did not give a shit about anything eh it does not matter who cares you know i just remember being like what is going on
was ityou would never met the other guy before adnan right so you did not know what was normal behavior for him
clearly it was not normal behavior for anybody
clearly you could tell something was going on something was going on that was not good and yeah it was just strange behavior for anybody
think that is been the one thing i have always remembered like how he said it how he looked when he said it
he is definitely panicked he is definitely worried
and
i could imagine if i was in a position that is what i would have been saying on the phone to my best friend you know my god what am i going to do they are going to come talk to me what am i supposed to say you know trying to come up with some story quickly
oh it is nothing
i did not get a full account
the next time i talked to adnan i told him how cathy still remembered all this stuff how shady the whole scene was for her and he said that on a bunch of levels what cathy had to say did not hold much water with him first of all if someone had called him to warn him the police were about to call why would he then answer the phone when the police called
i mean if i was expecting the police to call me i probably would not have answered my phone then
long pause
but then it still leaves us with the third person this third individual
so now who was this third person on the phone so at some point her memory either benefits me or it does not benefit me
her testimony does not look good for you you know because she is not really connected to jay she is not connected to you you know she is a little bit more objective i would say and she really thought you were acting very strangely you know so it did not it is not good for you what she has to say clears throat
adnan syed
do not
like i seriously doubt she would have gave this a second thought had i never been charged with haes murder
he did not identify himself
she assumed it was adnan
westview mall she says she saw them arrive in adnans car
n the adnan side that detail has always stuck with me too that jenn says adnan seemed so normal
the thing about jenn and cathy though is that even though they do not look great for adnan they do not actually contradict adnans own account of that evening
which i think is why he kind of shrugs them off and why i am sometimes tempted to shrug them off
because adnan has always admitted he was hanging out with jay that night
so so what if a couple of people saw them together what does that prove
but now we come to the big one
it is the nisha call
think of it as a title capitalized the nisha call
nisha
adnan
silver spring
i do not and uh i have no idea why he would call and their
nisha
for a smoking gun she is very cute she looks like a chipmunk
thank you
ummm it is a little hard to recall but i remember him telling me that jay invite invited him over to a video store that he worked at and he basically well adnan walked in with his cell phone and then like he told me to speak with jay and i was like okay because jay wanted to say hi so i said hi to jay and that is all i can really recall
kevin urick
now if i had to guess i would say that the prosecutor is trying to get her to not mention the video store because it contradicts their story
hen she goes on she does not mention the video store to urick again
but still if adnan is supposedly at school  during this time and jay is not talking to nisha for two minutes and twentytwo seconds then who the hell is calling nisha
this is what adnan cannot explain
you can see he calls her a lot on his cell
very first number he dials
but if she she says she testifies that her phone does not have an answering machine or voicemail on it so who is picking up that call and talking for two and a half minutes or whatever it was two minutes and twentytwo seconds or some
because i am almost sure i remember i am sure i remember her phone having an answering machine or voicemail or something
i for sure a thousand percent say i was not in the car with him at that time or did i have access to the phone at that time because i was at school that day
i have swiveled the rubiks cube of this case so many different ways i have arranged and rearranged it to come up with alternate versions of how this day might have actually gone
and i can get pretty far in certain hypothetical directions
jays got the car jays got the phone all these calls are to his friends
and then i remember the nisha call and the whole thing crumbles
the nisha call is a big fat problem for adnan
adnan says his biggest fear is not being believed when he is sure about something he has a tendency to over explain to inundate you with facts and information and then corroboration for the facts and information
adnan syed
     anyone who knows me will say i kind of go overboard to the point where people will be like alright man we believe you it could be about anything it could be about whether it rained yesterday because in my mind it is something it is a personality quirk born of all this i mean i really i do not like to talk about things if i can prove no matter how silly it is
sarah koenig
he does it with anything he is a cook at the prison and he said he got into a discussion with some guys recently about barbecue sauce adnan was saying if you do not have molasses or brown sugar you can substitute pancake syrup and the guys were like nah no way and so at breakfast adnan made a little batch of barbecue sauce using pancake syrup
nobody needs barbecue sauce at breakfast time at the maximum security prison in cumberland maryland but he did it anyway
all these things that look bad for adnan everything that is raised my suspicion even stupid things i have run every single one of them by him i have got this thing in my head that i will catch him in a lie maybe just a tiny meaningless lie and that is going to be his tell and he will be caught
and then i do not believe him
that notion that people out there in the world people he went to school with who knew him do not believe him that they can imagine he is capable of killing hae adnan spent fifteen years thinking about that and then trying not to think about that
or if there was like hae fought back and there was all this stuff of me like dna like scratches
that used to really devastate me kind of you know what i am saying that used to just really really just strike me to my core and uh
     sarah koenig
     just like what is it about me that would allow someone to even entertain the possibility that i could do this is that the thing
they saying that i plotted and planned and kept my true intentions hidden i mean just some real devious cruel like hitler type stuff you know what i mean just some real some like cruel cruel like inhuman type stuff like wow man you know what i mean i obviously i am not saying that i was a great person or anything but i do not think i ever displayed any tendencies like that
where a person would think that you know i mean maybe who knows maybe if it would have happened to someone else i would have believed it just because i naturally would have assumed that well if the police got the right guy they got him for the right reasons
what the hell does that even mean
no they do not no they not everyone has the ability to do something cruel and heinous like this
him
i thought i did not care about this too much but obviously i probably do
well because you know ityou know it kind of does not really matter what people think you know what i am saying it does not uh i should not care
but then i see many problems with adnans story too and so i start to doubt him i talk to him and talk to him and i start to doubt my doubts
and then i worry that i am a sucker that i do not know
that is the cycle
but i also told him really what really hooked me most was him just trying to figure out who is this person who says he did not kill this girl but is serving a life sentence for killing this girl
my interest in it honestly has been you like you are a really nice guy like i like talking to you you know so then it is kind of like this question of well what does that mean you know
i mean you do not even really know me though uh koenig
i am you do not i i maybe you do maybe i do not we only talk on the phone i do not understand
but wait are you saying you do not think that i know you at all
i mean for you to say that i am a great person i mean like a nice person then you know what i am saying that i ido not know i have only talked to you on the phone a few times i do not  i mean i guess you investigated me back then
and so i was a little bit like taken aback and i still like i guess feel a little taken aback that like what do you think i do not know about you
to be honest with you it kind of i feel like i want to shoot myself if i hear someone else say i do not think he did it because you are a nice guy adnan
i would rather someone say adnan i think you are a jerk you are selfish you know you are a crazy sob you should just stay in there for the rest of your life except that i looked at your case and it looks you know like a little off
i understand this being a nice guy does not count as exculpatory evidence and if i am going to spend a year figuring out that he is a nice guy i might as well piss off point taken
maybe we need some experts on this job

How long I been on this streak?
Dream about work in my sleep
Okay, I got a lock on the streets
Shoutout to T, he did three
And he brought it in 'cause of me
Long as they pockets is greaze (
Greaze!

Dust a man down with the pen, it's a sweep

So many mothers sighing (Sighing)
News had just come over
We had five years left to cry in (Cry in)
News guy wept and told us
Earth was really dying (Dying)
Cried so much his face was wet
Then I knew he was not lying (Lying)
I heard telephones, opera house, favourite melodies
I saw boys, toys, electric irons and TVs
My brain hurt like a warehouse, it had no room to spare
I had to cram so many things to store everything in there
And all the fat, skinny people
And all the tall, short people
And all the nobody people
And all the somebody people
I never thought I'd need so many people
A girl my age went off her head
Hit some tiny children
If the Black hadn't have pulled her off
I think she would have killed them
A soldier with a broken arm
Fixed his stare to the wheels of a Cadillac
A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest
And a queer threw up at the sight of that
I think I saw you in an ice-cream parlour
Drinking milkshakes cold and long
Smiling and waving and looking so fine
Don't think you knew you were in this song
And it was cold and it rained, so I felt like an actor
And I thought of Ma and I wanted to get back there
Your face, your race, the way that you talk
I kiss you, you're beautiful, I want you to walk

Does this look like an arcade? Tryna play games?
Or get sauteed and rotisseried while you're hog-tied
MCs get so quiet you can hear a motherfuckin' dog whistle when I walk by
Colt Seavers on a mule, stuntin' on that ass like the fuckin' Fall Guy
I don't gas my Mercedes after midnight, I treat it like a Mogwai
'Cause it will turn into a Gremlin
and run over kids, women, and men
Bitch, give me them digits, why you cringin'?
Do you think it's gonna cost me a pretty penny? Shit, if I think a penny's pretty
Just imagine how beautiful a quarter is to me;
Eenie-meenie-miney-mo
Catch an Eskimo by his toe while he's tryna roll a snowball
But don't make him lose his cool, if he hollers, better let him go, y'all
You don't own me
Now here we go, go, go
Get up, baby, get a move on like a U-Haul,
you can rack your brain
Like pool balls;
Well, here I come, Havoc on the beat, I wreak it;
Evil, I see
Hear, and speak it,
Put your eggs in the same basket, you can count every motherfuckin'
Chicken 'fore it hatches
'cause you can bet your ass that we gonna get it crackin'
Like the Kraken and Titans when they're clashin',
get your brains bashed in
So bad, you will have Kurt Cobain askin' to autograph a bloodstained napkin
Unfashionable,
and 'bout as rational as a rash on a fag's asshole
Now let's take that line, run it up the flagpole
With Elton, see if he's cool with it,
Y'all are so motherfuckin' full of shit that you're stocked up
Me, I'm always shittin' diarrhea of the mouth 'til your speakers crap out (*
fart
*) Huh, what?
Girl, you got a hot butt like a lit cigarette (Chig-chigga-ret-ret)
But you won't get a hot fudge sundae from me
You don't own me
Now here we go, go, go
And now that I got your panties in a bunch and your bowels in an uproar
I'ma show you why I came, so you stop askin' me, ""What the fuck for?""
Now look you little slut, cunt, whore, I know you want more
Bitch, it's time to put the math back into Mathers 'cause I'm a fuckin' problem—run, boy!
Comes straight from the fish's ass, yeah, in other words, I'm a bass-turd
Lookin' at me like I killed Kenny, gas in the tank—yeah, still plenty
No morals are instilled in me,
Eat your heart out, Hannibal, understandable why you're jealous
Fuck an animal, I got cannibal magnetism, can't resist him now—can you, hoe?
Bitch, I flow
Like Troy Polamalu's hair, boy, don't you dare try to follow or compare, boy
I'm raw, you ain't even medium-rare,
All this weak shit, what am I, steroids?
Well, bitch, I'm back with some shit for that ass and your trunk, elephant hemorrhoids
You don't own me
Now here we go, go, go
Thank you for coming out
I hope you enjoyed the show
'Til next time (Ha-ha)

Under me, I see all the people that claim they over me
I'd have to be dead for them to say that you took it from me
CJ grab racks out the bag and throw it to me
Trust in my brothers is as strong as I know it should be
Future sign the contracts, he don't even show it to me
I need you, I need you, I need you
I need to make you see
What you mean to me
Until I do, I'm hoping you will know what I mean
The city's on fire and people are in denial
Charges being laid, but we'll see what they do at trial
I'm calling this shit from now
Sweetheart deals that the judges been handing down
I used to hide my pain in Delilah behind the bar 'til my niggas carried me out
And if money's all I need in my grave, then bury me now
I know I tend to talk about how I got a fortune on me
But with that comes the politics the city been forcing on me
Man, I can't even R.I.P. and show my remorse to the homie
Know I carry the guilt of the city's misfortunes on me
Career is going great, but now the rest of me's fading slowly
Seen too many brothers get twenty-five from the boys
I'd rather see all of 'em get twenty-five from the Lord
And if the last negotiation made you pay me twenty-five
Well, this is the perfect time to give me twenty-five more
Co-parent of the year, we figured out a rapport
No fair what Drizzy made on the second leg of the tour
How the **** do we manage to win everything but awards?
And if the last negotiation had you feeling out of pocket
Well, this is the perfect time that I empty them shits for sure
You owe that shit to the boy, yeah

And this will all be mine?
Everything
Everything the light touches
In my freshest J's
Cause this the summer that our life change
Hov asked me, ""Is you ready for it?""
I looked around at all his nice things
Told him, ""Nigga, you already know it""
Bitch, I'm the man of the year
Straight through this bitch
What you 'sposed to do when the OG niggas don't get it?
Lost what was once theirs but they won't quit it
Homie, it's a new era, middle finger to the suit-wearers
Lemme show you how to move in a room
Full of dudes that don't got a fuckin' clue how to do this
Prolly worked with Cube, so to them, this a Rubik
My President is black, but my jeweler's still Jewish
So you know it cost, he makin' a killing off me
Red diamonds he designing got me shining
my chain blinding
Me and Hovi Hov, out on the same island
Took the whip to the other side of Jamaica
Seen how he was living, said ""I gotta get my weight up""
Being good is good, that'll get you Drew Gooden
But me, I want Jordan numbers, LeBron footin'
Can't guard me, Vince Lombardi, John Wooden
you niggas silly like Chris Farley
So like him, you'll be gone too early
Mama hands together like 6:30
And Cole keep a thick bitch I like to call Big Shirley
All my '90s niggas is gon' get it
18 and under, that's prolly gonna take a minute
At the time of this rhyme, 5 years 'til I know 30
This next shit is in no way to boast
But my city love breakfast, 'cause niggas had toast early
Coach had us doin' jumpin' jacks
Then sent us to the water fountain after runnin' laps
My nigga went and grabbed his bookbag, threw it on his back
And brought it to me just to show me he was fuckin' strapped
We was twelve years old, how was we to know better?
I analyzed his life and see that he was so set up
Means you don't got a nigga comin' 'round to guide a nigga
All you got is mama bringin' home these rotten niggas
Blowin' reefers, all the teachers do is ride a nigga
So this is who I speak fo'
Yeah, I stunt, but I'm a li'l more realer
When it come from the heart, don't it feel mo' iller?
Watch my flow go bananas, I'm a li'l gorilla
They say I rep that 'Ville too much, but that shit just a part of me
It's flowin' out through my arteries,
You JV, I'm varsity
ain't hard to see,
this real shit, you R&B
(Woo!) That boy Simba crazy
Hotter than Ike Turner temper,
you December, maybe
And though you wish me well, I know deep down you wish I'd fail
It's Judgment Day, I'm here to give you pussy niggas hell
Yeah, I heard the hate, but the wait is fuckin' over
It's like I'm fuckin' Oprah, well worth the wait
Maybe over your head,
I'm ahead of my time
Niggas scared of my future, I know they dreadin' my prime

Until I found it's me versus me
Why, why, why, why?
Why, why, why, why?
Just remember, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
!
We gon' put it in reverse
Darling, I told you many times
And I am telling you once again
Just to remind you, sweetheart
That my—
Oh, Lamar
Hail Mary and marijuana, times is hard
Pray with the hooligans, shadows all in the dark
Fellowship with demons and relatives, I'm a star
Life is one funny ma'fucker
A true comedian, you gotta love him, you gotta trust him
I might be buggin', infomercials and no sleep
Introverted by my thoughts; children, listen, it gets deep
See, once upon a time inside the Nickerson Garden projects
The object was to process and digest poverty's dialect
Adaptation inevitable: gun violence, crack spot
Federal policies raid buildings and drug professionals
Anthony was the oldest of seven
Well-respected, calm and collected
Laughin' and jokin' made life easier; hard times, mama on crack
A four-year-old tellin' his nanny he needed her
His family history: pimpin' and bangin'
He was meant to be dangerous
clocked him a grip and start slangin'
Fifteen, scrapin' up his jeans with quarter pieces
Even got some head from a smoker last weekend
Dodged a policeman, workin' for his big homie
Small-time hustler, graduated to a brick on him
That was back when he turned his back and they killed his cousin
He beat the case and went back to hustlin'
Bird-shufflin', Anthony rang
The first in the projects with the two-tone Mustang, that 5.0 thing
They say 5-0 came
circlin' parking lots and parking spots
And hoppin' out while harrassin' the corner blocks
Crooked cops told Anthony he should kick it
He brushed 'em off and walked back to the Kentucky Fried Chicken
See, at this chicken spot, there was a light-skinned nigga that talked a lot
With a curly top and a gap in his teeth, he worked the window
His name was Ducky
he came from the streets, The Robert Taylor Homes
Southside Projects, Chiraq, the Terror Dome
Drove to California with a woman on him and five-hundred dollars
They had a son, hopin' that he'd see college
Hustlin' on the side with a nine-to-five to freak it
Cadillac Seville, he'd ride his son around on weekends
Three-piece special with his name on the shirt pocket
'Cross the street from the projects, Anthony planned to rob it
Stuck up the place before, back in '84
That's when affiliation was really at gears of war
So many relatives tellin' us, sellin' us devilish works, killin' us, crime
Intelligent, felonious prevalent proposition with 9's
Ducky was well-aware
They robbed the manager and shot a customer last year
He figured he'd get on these niggas' good sides
Free chicken every time Anthony posted in line, two extra biscuits
Anthony liked him and then let him slide, they didn't kill him
In fact, it look like they're the last to survive
pay attention
That one decision changed both of they lives, one curse at a time
Reverse the manifest and good karma, and I'll tell you why
You take two strangers and put 'em in random predicaments
Give 'em a soul, so they can make their own choices and live with it
Twenty years later, them same strangers, you make 'em meet again
Inside recording studios where they reapin' their benefits
Then you start remindin' them about that chicken incident
Whoever thought the greatest rapper would be from coincidence?
Because if Anthony killed Ducky, Top Dawg could be servin' life
While I grew up without a father and die in a gunfight

220,Diamonds From Sierra Leone Remix,Kanye West,2005,835024,https://genius.com/Kanye-West-Diamonds-From-Sierra-Leone-Remix-lyrics,"[Intro: Shirley Bassey]
Diamonds are forever
They are all I need to please me
They can stimulate and tease me
They won't leave in the night
I've no fear that they might desert me
Diamonds are forever
Forever, forever
(Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe)
Diamonds are forever
Forever, forever
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
(
Forever
) Forever ever? Forever ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
(
And ever
) Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
Good mornin', this ain't Vietnam, still
People lose hands, legs, arms, for real
Little was known of Sierra Leone
And how it connect to the diamonds we own
My chain, these ain't conflict diamonds
Is they, Jacob? Don't lie to me, mane
See, a part of me sayin' keep shinin'
How when I know what a blood diamond is?
Though it's thousands of miles away
Sierra Leone connect to what we go through today
Over here, it's a drug trade, we die from drugs
Over there, they die from what we buy from drugs
The diamonds, the chains, the bracelets, the charmses
I thought my Jesus piece was so harmless
'Til I seen a picture of a shorty armless
And here's the conflict
It's in a black person soul to rock that gold
Spend your whole life tryna get that ice
On a Polo rugby, it look so nice
How can somethin' so wrong make me feel so right?
Right? 'Fore I beat myself up like Ike
You can still throw your Roc-a-Fella diamond tonight, because
Diamonds are forever
Forever, forever
Diamonds are forever
Forever, forever
The Roc is still alive every time I rhyme
(
Forever
) Forever ever? Forever ever?
Ever, ever? Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
(
And ever
) Ever, ever? Ever, ever?
[Verse 2: Kanye West &
JAY-Z
]
People askin' me is I'm gon' give my chain back (
Uh
)
That'll be the same day I give the game back (
Uh
)
You know the next question, dawg, ""Yo, where Dame at?"" (
Uh
)
This track the Indian dance that bring our rain back (
Woo
)
I got it from here, 'Ye, damn
The chain remains, the gang is intact (Uh-huh)
The name is mine, I'll take blame for that
The pressure's on, but guess who ain't gon' crack?
Haha, pardon me, I had to laugh at that
How could you falter when you're the Rock of Gibraltar?
I had to get off the boat so I could walk on water
This ain't no tall order, this is nothin' to me
Difficult takes a day, impossible takes a week
I do this in my sleep, I sold kilos of coke (So?)
I'm guessin' I can sell CDs
I'm not a businessman, I'm a business, man
Let me handle my business, damn
Kanyeez you got me, Freeway then Foxy
YG's, Teairra Mari, Peedi watch me
Bleek could be one hit away his whole career
As long as I'm alive, he's a millionaire
And even if I die, he's in my will somewhere
So he could just kick back and chill somewhere, oh, yeah
He won't even have to write rhymes
The Dynasty like my money: last three lifetimes
Shirley Bassey's in the rear, sayin' exactly
What I been sayin' practically my whole career
The diamond is forever, I've been minin' this forever
Now the Louis Vuitton Don's timin' couldn't be better
People lined up to see the Titanic sinkin'
Instead, we rose up from the ash like a phoenix
If you're waitin' for the end of the Dynasty sign
It would seem like forever is a mighty long time
I'm Young, bitches!

He's the heartbeat of the people
The ghetto people, and when I say ghetto people

Some of these people do not even have TV, so they can't afford cable
Some of them can afford a radio
So the only thing they can listen to is the music
People the ghetto, people from the projects, street people
Hortical ghetto youth who know what it is to sing about suffering and reality
New York girl, dem a mad over we
New York girl, dem a mad over we
New York girl, dem a mad over we
New York girl, dem a mad over we
Smoking a escubano
Hope I don't catch a hommo
grossing our net
Simultaneously making me climb higher
Heinous crimes behind me
So anyone move next, I'll hit you with two TECs
Rocking Roberto Cavalli, no shirt on, convertible Mazi
My Colombiana mommy riding beside me
Every tat mean something, that's my word on my body
I'll have to lean something with that Mossberg shotty
My niggas is ignant, put lead in your pigment
In '97 the six
'98 the Bentley
Now it's the Ghost Phantom
Army jacket swag, army jacket green and black
With the square top pocket that snaps
where the gas at?
you hold cracks in your ass crack
I never did that, my sock's where my stash was at
Yo, I used to listen to that Red Alert
and Rap Attack
I fell in love with all that poetry I mastered that
Cutting school where Preme team and Fat Cat was at
Future not crystal clear yet, Baccarat
Now I'm the one who repping Queens
Way beyond your wildest dreams
Twenty years in this game, looking seventeen
I don't lean: no codeine, promethazine
I just blow green, pick which bitch to bless the king
Although he's on to another chapter
Heavy D gave this beat to Salaam for me to rap to
New York is like an Island, a big Rikers Island
The cops be out wilding, all I hear is sirens
It's all about surviving, same old two-step
Try to stay alive when they be out robbing
I been out rhyming since born knowledge
Like prophet Muhammad said the ink from a scholar
Worth more than the blood of a martyr
so I'ma
Keep it on 'til I see a billion dollars
Keep your friends close and your enemies closer
Love model chocha, mami pop it like she 'pose to

To all the baby's mamas' mamas
Mamas, mamas, baby mamas' mamas
Yeah, go like this
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologized a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologized a trillion times
My baby a drama mama don't like me
She be doin' things like havin' them boys
Come from her neighborhood to the studio, tryna fight me
She need to get a piece of the American pie and take her bite out
That's my house, I'll disconnect the cable and turn the lights out
And let her know her grandchild is a baby and not a pay check
Private school, daycare, shit, medical bills, I pay that
I love your mom and everything
But see, I ain't the only one who laid down
She wanna rib you up to start a custody war, my lawyers stay down
She never got a chance to hear my side of the story, we was divided
She had fish fries and cookouts for my child's birthday, I ain't invited
Despite it I show her the utmost respect when I fall through
All you, do is defend that lady when I call you, yeah
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologized a trillion times
I'm sorry, Ms. Jackson, ooh, I am for real
Never meant to make your daughter cry
I apologized a trillion times
Me and your daughter got a special thang goin' on (We got a special kinda thing)
You say it's puppy love, we say it's full-grown (Arroof)
Hope that we feel this, feel this way forever
You can plan a pretty picnic but you can't predict the weather
Ms. Jackson
Ten times out of nine, now if I'm lyin', find
The quickest muzzle, throw it on my mouth and I'll decline
King meets queen, then the puppy love thing
Together dream 'bout that crib with the Goodyear swing
On the oak tree,
I hope we feel like this forever
Forever, forever ever? Forever ever?
Forever never seems that long until you're grown
And notice that the day-by-day ruler can't be too wrong
Ms. Jackson, my intentions were good, I wish I could
Become a magician to abracadabra all the sadder
Thoughts of me, thoughts of she, thoughts of he
Asking what happened to the feeling that her and me had
I pray so much about it, need some knee pads
It happened for a reason, one can't be mad
So know this, know that everything's cool
And yes, I will be present on the first day of school and graduation

""Look at the way he treats me"", shit, look at the way you treat me
You see, your little nosy-ass homegirls done got your ass sent up the creek, G
Without a paddle, you left to straddle and ride this thing on out (Out)
Now you and your girl ain't speakin' no more 'cause my dick all in her mouth (Mouth)
Know what I'm talkin' about?
Jealousy, infidelity, envy, cheating, beating in the year 2G, they be the same thing
So who you placin' the blame on? You keep on singin' the same song
Let bygones be bygones and you can go on and get the hell on, you and your mama

Light an L to alleviate the head stress
My emotions roll over like the head rest
On the plane I connected under sunsets
Start a rhyme for the time I got nothing left
I’m not high this evening, what an upset
Which flight will get me lifted where the sun rest?
Time zones, don't know if she up yet
Google drone, Metro phone, what's the subset?
Finding out on your location what is obsessed?
I’m just kidding for the moment, maybe not yet
Steady chasing your reflection, so eternal yet
She was mountainous like Denver
Oh, how you would November
Hug me tighter in the winter
Sweater sessions, touching linen
Fire burning on your shoulder, you remember
That our life is all worth living
Even in times of forgiveness
It hurts to be so cold
Seeing you warm within December
Without your favorite nigga
Bob could probably paint the pictures
Flowers on your windows
Because you're my favorite art
You're my canvas, you're my heart
Never (Never) have I met someone like you, ahh
Showed me two options so I had to take the third door
Had to take some time to analyze what really hurts more
Vacant from the nine to five or being poor and goin’ for it
Walkin' round, hazy vision living in a time lapse
We were never meant for that, I admire mama, spent her life
So my environment’s conducive to aspiring, she's ironclad
When life strikes, she fires back
Resilient despite my dad's absence, oh, I admire that
I got my CDs, my tees and my flyers packed
This is for my young lads and those who love my prior acts
Lump me with the 2010 kids who rap sad and act cathartic
Middle class aggression once expressed through wack guitar riffs
And this ain’t for the niggas who would tweet before act
This is for my people out of reach of relief, can't speak so they rap
For the tongue tied young minds out seekin' a gat
Holdin' on to they sanity while we preachin' our sentiments
Of lovin' humanity while they can't see the evidence
Been through the ringer of self-doubt and depression
It ain't a preference, I hope they hear me, 'cause I'll be here tellin' them that
Never (Never), ahh (Never)
Never (Never) have I met someone like you, ahh
Never (Never), ahh (Never)
Never (Never) have I met someone like you, ahh
Turbulence (Turbulence)
Is more than mere disturbances
Helps you learn to yearn for life
To reassess your worth and shit
Helps you learn to yearn for life
To reassess your worth and shit
Don't forget to be yourself (And you'll be just fine)
I'll be just fine

And one day we will die
And our ashes will fly

And count every beautiful thing we can see

There are lights in the clouds

Hear her voice as it's rolling and ringing through me

How the notes all bend and reach above the trees

How I would push my fingers through
Your mouth to make those muscles move
All secrets sleep in winter clothes
With the one you loved so long ago
Now he don't even know his name

And when we meet on a cloud
I'll be laughing out loud
I'll be laughing with everyone I see

When the pimp's in the crib, ma
(Drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot)
When the pigs try to get at you
(Park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot, park it like it's hot)
And if a nigga get a attitude
(Pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot)
I got the Rollie on my arm and I'm pourin' Chandon
I roll the best weed
I'm a nice dude (Uh), with some nice dreams
See these ice cubes?
See these Ice Creams?
That's whiter than what's spillin' down your throat
The Phantom, exterior like fish eggs
The interior like suicide-wrist red
I can exercise you, this can be your Phys. Ed
Cheat on your man,
ma, that's how you get ahizzead
Killer with the beat,
I know killers in the street
With the steel that'll make you feel like Chinchilla in the heat
So don't try to run up on my ear talkin' all that raspy shit, tryna ask me shit
When my niggas fill your vest, they ain't gon' pass me shit
*ticking*
*ding*
Matter-fact, you should take four, B
lil' Skateboard P
When the pimp's in the crib, ma
(Drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot)

And if a nigga get a attitude
(Pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot, pop it like it's hot)
I got the Rollie on my arm and I'm pourin' Chandon
I roll the best weed
I keep a blue flag hangin' out my backside
But only on the left side, yeah, that's the Crip side
I cut so much, you thought I was a DJ *vinyl rewind*
(Two, re-pe-re-pe, one, yep, three)
dizzle
I got a livin' room full of fine dime brizzles
When the pimp's in the crib, ma
(Drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot, drop it like it's hot)
I'm a bad boy with a lotta hoes
Drive my own cars and wear my own clothes
On the TV screen and in the magazines
If you play me close, you're on a red beam
AK-47 now, nigga, stop that
Cement shoes, now I'm on the move
Your family's cryin', now you on the news
They can't find you and now they miss you

And you ain't going back?
I don't want to be her man, I want to be her nigga
You fucking with niggas that's insecure
Watered down, my shit is pure
Dripping wet, as we experiment in sweaty sex
To find out me and your man be sharing skirts
I'm hoping you don't take this the wrong way
But your body is banging, got me attracted in a strong way
After a long day of trying to make my songs pay
Making love all day against the wall in the hallway
Your fantasies come alive, your heart rate
Shall increase when we meet up in this dark place
You might think you're happy with him
But that's a lie, so give this thug a try
I'd rather be ya N-I-G-G-A (
I'd rather be yo' nigga

So we can get drunk and smoke weed all day
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life
These busters ain't loving you right
It don't matter if you lonely baby, you need a thug in your life
('Cause) These busters ain't loving you right

Amerikaz Most Wanted
Now many questions are often asked, a drop top, 500 Benz
And plenty cash, to help a nigga get the ass
Smoke blunts but leave them stunts up to Super Dave
He wine and dine, but me and you we whine and grind

Someone tell these motherfuckers that Hop is back!

Now I’m ready to fuck the game up, nigga
They can get it (They can get it)
You can get it (You can get it)
Y'all can get it (It really doesn't matter, nigga)
Yeah! The Dark Knight's in this bitch
Without the mask and cape,
I'm actin' ape shit
Faggot, embrace it,
I just got validation
On my ass-whoopin' ticket; I'm that amazin'
It's my mad invasion of smashin' brains in
My fuckin' pen and pad was anxious
All these haters who mad and be naggin' at me
I flip they ass off like an acrobat on a trapeze
And I'll be lashin' back like a Shaq attack on these rap beats
You thought that I was done with completely bein' an ass? (Please)
Don't think you raw just 'cause you got success
I'll uppercut your ass so many times
You look like you was noddin' yes
I'm the only child that my mom regrets
Probly best that you don't buy my album
Save your money, yo, do not invest
Your bullshit, come off of that

And strip survival,
It’s sick and spiteful,
2Pac’s twisted grim disciple
I been this nice, yo, way before Michael had vitiligo
Am I Hopsin or am I Lucifer?
I didn't blow 'til I started talkin' a gang of shit
Tell me who you prefer
I'd die and do my next show as a hologram
And still be realer than you
See, I'm the shit, like I slithered in poo
I'm sicker than stickin' my freakin' dick
Inside a bitch's syphilis cooch;
it's
Knock Madness

Yeezus
But I burned it first, heard it, and snapped it in five pieces
Man, Kanye on that bullshit
That’s why the paparazzi made that nigga hit his fuckin' head, that’s what that fool get
You think you God now
You half-assin' rap little faggot bitch?
Perhaps you suffered brain damage
Back when you had that accident
But most importantly, hip-hop isn’t dead no more, you see
'Cause Kendrick took the bar
And then raised it up higher for MC's
Unfortunately the little nigga's like 4 feet 3
The guy's a fuckin' midget, his high is still really short to me
Fuck givin' my pencil breaks
My mental state tells me to renovate
If you hand me your shit, I'll toss your demo tape
“Hop, if you're not spreading love
Then why do you even write music?""
'Cause this is how I feel
When I ain’t rappin' on the mic, you bitch!
Am I supposed to coat it up? Am I not allowed to open up?
I spill the blood of rappers
And use Weezy dreads to soak it up
Bustin' like South Central driveby's
Support the guy with white eyes

This is a Global-Tel link prepaid call from Adnan Syed an inmate at a Maryland Correctional facility…
From This American Life and WBEZ Chicago, it's Serial. One story told week by week. I'm Sarah Koenig. Remember how last time I ended by saying that the detectives had other leads in this case besides Mr. S, the guy who found Hae's body, that they were also starting to look at Adnan? Well, the reason we know that is because of this memo:
The memo is dated 12 February 1999. It's from Detective Darryl Massey to Detective Greg MacGillivary.
,
Asian Male 18 to 21 years old,” though its unclear whether Asian in this case means East Asian like Korean or South Asian like Pakistani.
But anyway, a mystery caller says look at the ex-boyfriend.
the caller further stated that the victim broke off the relationship with her boyfriend about a week before she was reported missing.
“oh yeah, by the way...”
friend of his (Vasser 	Ali – Asian Male – 17) “if he ever hurt his girlfriend, he would drive her car into a lake.”
This time the caller mentions a friend of Adnan's, Vasser Ali.
Actually, the name of this friend is
Yasser
The caller says Yasser might know something. Hangs up again. The cops can't trace the call. It's out of range.
The cops didn't figure it out. Adnan's attorney didn't figure it out. I've tried to figure it out too.
Because it seemed to me whoever made this call, he must be the key to the whole thing.
But so far, I only have guesses that I can't responsibly say out loud.
They get a subpoena for Adnan's cell phone records. The results of that subpoena include a list of all the calls dialed and received on Adnan's phone on January 13, the day Hae disappeared.
That list will become arguably the most important piece of paper among all the thousands in this case. It'll become their map. And they'll follow it call by call by call, like footprints that end up at Adnan's front door.
log
Obviously, the first thing they had to do was figure out who all the phone numbers belong to. Home, cell, and pager numbers. Once they do, they realize, “wait a minute. One person was called six times that
That person is an eighteen year old girl named Jennifer Pusateri. Jenn is not a friend of Adnan's. She's a friend of Jay's. Remember, Jay had Adnan's car that day and his new cell phone.
Jennifer Pusateri
And I was like alright. He's like, but I gotta tell you. I gotta tell somebody. I can't, you know. And I was like alright – what's up dude? He's like, um, Adnan killed Hae
And that's when I was just like – woah – what do you mean Adnan killed Hae? Why? What? How? When? Where? You know?
If you want to figure out this case with me, now is the time to start paying close attention because we have arrived, along with the detectives, at the heart of the thing.
This
February 27, 1999.
Then Jenn and a friend go see Jay.
She tells Jay, “the police want to talk to me. What do I do?”
At trial, Jenn says, “he told me to go down there and tell them what I knew. Tell them enough to keep me out of trouble and tell them to go see Jay. Send them his way.”
she lies to them.
She says she doesn't know anything. I've seen the detectives notes from that interview and they're remarkably uninteresting. But by the time she left that night, Jenn thought it was possible she was about to get charged.
“everyone's a suspect and no one's a suspect.”
They turn on a tape recorder –
who, what, where, when, why
he said that Adnan said that Hae broke his heart.
So, Jenn gives them a motive. Hae broke Adnan's heart
He told me, um, he told me, this is what he told me, he told me, he asked, Jay asked me what we should do?
“Adnan showed me her body and asked me if I would help her bury him
Did you help him?
Do you know where the body is?” “No. I just took him to some place in the city and I dropped him off.
Yo
u know, when, you know, when was this done?” He didn't know when.
Yeah, he said that he strangled her in a Best Buy parking lot. But I don't know how he got to a Best Buy parking lot or anything like that.
Jay has told her I saw the body in the trunk of a car.
I didn't – I refused
house – and he tells her that all this went down at the Best Buy parking lot, off Security Boulevard about a mile from Woodlawn Highschool.
Jay and Jenn were close friends at this time, winter of ‘99 – talking or hanging out almost everyday. They'd known each other since elementary school and they were in the same class at Woodlawn.
She's in a sorority.
Jay left her house sometime between 3:45 and 4:15
Adnan says hi to her. She says he seems to be acting normal.
The shovels Adnan had used to dig in the park to bury Hae – that they were Jay's shovels from his house.
Jennifer Pusateri
Jay can retrieve the shovels and wipe the handles clean in case of fingerprints
After that, Jay came back, got in my car, and he was really shooken up. He was completely shooken up. He was like you have to take me to go see my girlfriend now.
The next day Jenn says she drove Jay to the F&M store, that same one where he worked, so that he could throw out the clothes and boots he was wearing the previous night. He pitched them into a dumpster behind the store. One of the cops points out that, for a guy who's telling you he didn't kill anyone and didn't help dispose of a body, he sure is taking a lot of precautions
Jay wasn't along when the body was buried?
– But he's thrown away all of his clothes and he's wiping finger prints off the shovels, things of that nature--
Yeah. Well. It wasn't until today that I thought, I mean, I just don't think that Jay...
I don't think that Jay would lie to me, first of all, and, like, I don't know – unless Adnan paid Jay a good sum of money, I really don't see Jay helping him.
“Oh no. More like casual acquaintances.”
So they get Jay in the interview room and, initially, he pulls a Jenn. He tells them nothing, more or less. He says he walked to the mall that day, got his girlfriend a new bracelet for her birthday, hung around with Jenn's younger brother, talked to Adnan sometime in the afternoon, and then, after two pages of notes like that, it says, “Alright, I come clean.”
At least, that's what I think it says. The detective's handwriting is messy so maybe it says, “A bright eye came down.”
In any case, around twenty minutes later they start taping and Jay tells them a whole different story, one that more or less matches Jenn's – except for one major difference. One major piece of information about this crime that the cops are still missing. They do not know where Hae's car is. They've been looking all over the place for it. They can't find it. Now, Jay tells them he knows where it is.
that
Jay will take them to the car. And he does.
They said some-something like “we know what you and Jay did” or “we talked to Jay”-- and I'm like “Jay? Jay--” like I had a look of puzzlement on my face – like, like “what? What do you mean? Like what do you mean Jay?”
And then the same guy, MacGillivary, he kinda like snorted – like – hmph, you know what we're talking about. No I mean, I had, I had no idea and the reaction that he gave me was like stop playing dumb.
It's not like there was some secret feud between Jay and Adnan, at least not that I know of. There was no drug deal gone wrong. Neither had bad mouthed the other or stolen the other's girlfriend. To hear Adnan tell it, it sounds like they didn't even know each other very well.
However, Adnan was close with Stephanie, Jay's girlfriend – very close.
Stephanie was smart, she was top athlete at the school, she was beautiful by any standard. She looked like a model.
She came from a family of achievers who did not approve of Jay but had no problem with Adnan. So maybe Stephanie's relationship with Adnan – how affectionate they were with each other, the constant talking on the phone, the prom prince and princess stuff – maybe that was gnawing at Jay.
Like, you know, when I was talking about how close I was with Stephanie, and they were like, you know, and you never – like, she looked at me like I was an idiot – like you never thought that this bothered Jay?
Adnan says he didn't feel betrayed by Jay exactly because, again, they weren't good enough friends for betrayal.
maybe somehow he got caught up – for a minute I thought he tried to claim the reward money and he got caught up in the situation.
A year after Adnan was arrested and the case came to trial, Jay walked up to the witness stand. There's a moment when Adnan muttered something to him. He says he couldn't help himself. The judge called the attorneys up to the bench. Quote - I was just informed by my Sheriff that the Defendant made a comment to the witness as the witness approached the stand indicating that he was pathetic, the judge said. I want to advise Mr. Syed that up until now he has been perfect -- don't spoil it.
I'm the criminal element of Woodlawn.
Perceived. It's like how the student body sees me. You know, I mean, people who really know me know that I'm not like that but, you know, you get a certain reputation and kinda sticks with you.
Because of the contacts you have with helping him get his marijuana, he thinks that you're in that element that would be willing to assist him in, um, disposing of the body?
     Jay
     I would guess so. That I would know someone or know where or something.
Do you really believe that the defendant, meaning Adnan, could go to one of his upstanding Magnet School Honor Student friends or a friend from the mosque to assist him with this act? Of course not. He needed someone who behaved a little more dangerously than those people. He needed someone who took risks. The defendant hopes that you will look at Jay and say I don't believe him.
That is why the defendant chose Jay.
They ask him “if you're actually not the type of guy who knows where to bury a body then why did you help? Why didn't you go to the police instead?”
He gives you his car keys. He gives you his cell phone. He tells you a time that he's going to call you. That he's going to kill her.
you do absolutely nothing
You were selling marijuana.
So if I go to the cops and say, “Hey, this guy is a killer.” He'll say, “well no I'm not, he's crazy but there's this drug dealer and here's where he gets his shit from and this is who he deals with and he's got a rap sheet this long and go get his ass.”
But you've never been arrested but one time. You don't really have a rap sheet.
Jay
On the record it's one time. But I've got my ass kicked plenty of times. I've got one arrest. Plenty of times. Dogs sicced on me – chased down out by my own house – fucking gun point, helicopters and shit with my keys in my hands, you know what I mean. It's not, it's not just, you know, I mean seriously man, I been coming home – people whipped out guns made me lay in the street in the snow walking to my own house – just so they can say I was a wrong dude, you know what I mean?
So you didn't trust any police?
     Jay
     I didn't. No. I don't
That never crosses my mind. I could be getting shot at and I wouldn't be “let's call the cops.”
Um, I was just scared and I didn't really think, like-like how it is.
Who are you afraid of if you make an anonymous phone call and you give a description of her car? You give them the tag number of her car...
Can we stop for a second?
     Detective
     Yes.
     Jay
     Can you stop that?
Detective
     If you have any questions, you can ask me on tape.
First it was just, like, shock and then after that, I was part of it. I mean I couldn't just...
Like I said, he knows I sold drugs, I mean...that was, I mean, that's...he could get me locked up for that, I mean. I'm sure if I ratted him out for killing Hae, then he wouldn't hesitate to turn me over for selling drugs.
Um, I feel bad that, you know, I mean, I didn't come forward or do anything but, I just, I feel bad, I mean I feel like I could have stopped it somehow if I, you know, maybe if I'd paid more attention, you know, talked about it.
I just feel bad about it
That's all. That's all I got to say.
The cops have a struggle with Jay. I have a struggle with Jay. He's the biggest mystery of this whole case for me.
Some of these discrepancies seem small to me and understandable but some are significant and confounding. That distance between where a certain detail starts and where it ends up – how far it slides and why it slides. I've spent untold hours trying to measure that distance – trying to weigh it for clues as to what might actually be true.
Westview mall
we did a little
That's a different mall, Security Square Mall – a couple miles away.
70 Park and Ride
At the first trial, Jay says they both got high in Adnan's car, but the second trial, he says only he smoked and Adnan didn't want to.
In the first taped interview, Jay says they're grabbing some food at a restaurant when Officer Adcock calls Adnon asking if he's seen Hae. The next time he tells it, he says that when that call comes, they're at a friend's apartment – a friend whose father happens to be a homicide detective in another county.
want to get her in trouble.
In the first taped statement, Jay says he refused to help dig a grave for Hae. Two weeks later, he says they both dug the hole.
But then, there are other changes – bigger changes – where its harder to judge why the details shift.
This one, for instance: In the first taped interview, Jay says Adnan only told him that same day that he was going to kill Hae. Two weeks later, Jay says that Adnan had started talking about it before hand – four or five days before.
I think I'm gonna kill her.
There's so many more of these. There's a whole side trip Adnan and Jay supposedly take that afternoon, after Hae's been killed to smoke some weed at Patapsco State Park. That trip disappears by trial – just drops out of the narrative – and Jay's whereabouts in between the time he drops Adnan back at school at midday and when he meets back up with him later that afternoon – the stories about where he is are so messy and so confusing that I can't even keep the different versions straight.
I went to pick him up from off of Edmondson Avenue at a strip and he, uh, popped the trunk open and
A strip is a small outdoor drug market
Yes.
Yes.
And the conversation was what?
Um, that bitch is dead. Come and get me. I'm at Best Buy.
Best Buy. Just like Jenn had originally told them. This is a problem for the cops – this change. Because it’s not something you forget – where you were when you saw a dead body in the trunk of a car. It's not a slip of the tongue and its not clear what the calculation is. Edmondson Avenue versus the Best Buy parking lot. What's the advantage of one place over the other? Why tell this lie?
Maybe he's just saying it because it matches Jenn's story – or did he lie to Jenn in the first place and then forget?
I h
cops are the most skeptical people in the world.
They pretty much assume everyone is lying to them all the time. Ritz and MacGillivary aren't newbies. MacGillivary came from a law enforcement family; his father had been captain of the homicide unit, in fact. And Ritz was known in the department, and in the state's attorney's office, as a skilled and meticulous investigator. So, they're not suckers. They're taking careful note of the changes in Jay's stories. It's why they keep going back to him – to clear up the inconsistencies.
In the second taped interview, MacGillivary confronts Jay – ticking off a list of the main things he's lied to him about and Jay admits to all the lies. But, even so, what struck me is that they don't really press him on any of it. The most forceful MacGillivary gets is this exchange about the location of the trunk pop.
Yes.
Sarah Koenig
When he told the Edmondson Avenue version, he was already deeply associated with it.
But MacGillivary lets it go – moves on to another point.
Jay
     To the best that I can possibly, humanly at this point and time remember. That is the truth.
Detective MacGillivary
Jay's story kept changing. You were catching the inconsistencies and he was having to explain them and clean up his story.
Ritz said they believed Jay's story because “we were able to investigate and corroborate what he was saying.”
So how exactly did they corroborate it

there is so many more of these there is a whole side trip adnan and jay supposedly take that afternoon after haes been killed to smoke some weed at patapsco state park that trip disappears by trial  just drops out of the narrative  and jays whereabouts in between the time he drops adnan back at school at midday and when he meets back up with him later that afternoon  the stories about where he is are so messy and so confusing that i cannot even keep the different versions straight
i went to pick him up from off of edmondson avenue at a strip and he uh popped the trunk open and
a strip is a small outdoor drug market
yes
yes
and the conversation was what
um that bitch is dead come and get me i am at best buy
best buy just like jenn had originally told them this is a problem for the cops  this change because it is not something you forget  where you were when you saw a dead body in the trunk of a car it is not a slip of the tongue and its not clear what the calculation is edmondson avenue versus the best buy parking lot what is the advantage of one place over the other why tell this lie
maybe he is just saying it because it matches jenns story  or did he lie to jenn in the first place and then forget
i h
cops are the most skeptical people in the world
they pretty much assume everyone is lying to them all the time ritz and macgillivary are not newbies macgillivary came from a law enforcement family his father had been captain of the homicide unit in fact and ritz was known in the department and in the states attorneys office as a skilled and meticulous investigator so they are not suckers they are taking careful note of the changes in jays stories it is why they keep going back to him  to clear up the inconsistencies
in the second taped interview macgillivary confronts jay  ticking off a list of the main things he is lied to him about and jay admits to all the lies but even so what struck me is that they do not really press him on any of it the most forceful macgillivary gets is this exchange about the location of the trunk pop
yes
sarah koenig
when he told the edmondson avenue version he was already deeply associated with it
but macgillivary let us it go  moves on to another point
jay
     to the best that i can possibly humanly at this point and time remember that is the truth
detective macgillivary
jays story kept changing you were catching the inconsistencies and he was having to explain them and clean up his story
ritz said they believed jays story because we were able to investigate and corroborate what he was saying
so how exactly did they corroborate it

Ever heard of Asperger's? It's a rare condition
It's what you're sufferin' from when you simply don't care if it's an
'Cause you got the windows up, blarin' the system
In your Chevrolet Prizm
The devil ain't on a level same as him
Picture someone who revels in straight masochism
Then imagine him givin' an adjective an ass-whoopin'
So bad they should put his ass in prison
A word bully, I verbally abuse verbs
Like they did somethin' to me personally
Used to get bullied, so I'd cut class and ditch it
Now I bully rap, I'm the shit, faggot (Sniff it)
Cadillac from a K Car
Came straight out the trailer park
Screamin', ""I'm proud to shop at K-Mart,"" and it became art
And I'm still fed up and as pissed off as they are
To this day I still get in fights with the same broad
At the same Walmart, arguin' over the same cart
You're ass-backwards like motherfuckin' Bob and Silent Jay
Illest shit you could think I would say
Slipped, fell straight down to the ground
Splattered all over the entire state
While I sashayed around flames with a match
And I gave him the gas face
And this ain't got nothin' to do with a scale
Or being gay, little faggot, but by the way
I'm a combination of Skylar Grey
Tyler, the Creator, and Violent J
It's a fuckin' miracle to be this lyrical
Paint my face with clown makeup and a smiley face
I'm sellin' hatred, buffet style, all the shit you can eat
$11.99, so come on and pile a plate
I'm loadin' up and I'm takin' names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell
I'm loading up and I'm taking names
I wanna dig my way to hell
I wanna dig my way to hell
I've been a career asshole
I don't see why these people always got my back
I done said so much fucked up shit
I was born a mistake,
slaughter tracks
I done put my two dimes and a nickel in this shit
I'm comin' to get that quarter back
Like Ndamukong, the drama can build
Your mama can ask me for my autograph
'Cause that cougar's a MILF
She's the oldest trick in the book, but I sure would fall for that
You done brought a bat to a rocket launcher fight
When I get on the mic I'ma snap
Make you wish the ambulance that took me to the hospital
When I overdosed woulda caught a flat
If it makes you sick to your stomach, acid indigestion
My suggestion's Kaopectate
If it feels like I'm runnin' away with the game
It's 'cause I am, don't speculate, spectate
All I got is dick for days and insults for decades
But I get by with my wicked ways
You ain't fly, you're an airhead
And I'm sick of poundin' a square peg in a round hole
Sorry, another catchphrase
But your baggage ain't gon' fit in my storage overhead space
'Cause it just ain't big enough to fit your damaged goods
Other words: don't try to put your heart in a headcase
'Cause, baby, stable mentally I ain't
I need my meds, I peed my bed
I'm going blind, I don't see my legs, I keep on falling down
No wonder you can't stand me, I need my cane
Someone help me, I think my face is melting
This G-I-A-N-T hole in my empty head
And you'd see why I be this way
(Psych) Psycho on a cyclone cycle, spiralin',
I'm nothin' but a hole inside your skull where your eye goes
'Cause I'ma sock it to you!
Dyke ho, you don't like it?
Get on your Harley Davidson menstrual cycle
And ride it like a motorbike
I'm finna blow the mic the whole night, so
And hi, ho, hand me my shovel!

The Grinch hated Christmas! The whole Christmas season!
Now, please don't ask why. No one quite knows the reason.
It could be, perhaps, that his shoes were too tight.
It could be his head wasn't screwed on just right.
But I think that the most likely reason of all
May have been that his heart was two sizes too small.
But, whatever the reason, his heart or his shoes,
He stood there on Christmas Eve hating the Whos,
Fahoo forays, dahoo dorays
Welcome Christmas! Come this way
Fahoo forays, dahoo dorays
Welcome Christmas, Christmas Day
Welcome, welcome, fahoo ramus
Welcome, welcome, dahoo damus
Christmas Day is in our grasp
So long as we have hands to clasp
Fahoo forays, dahoo dorays...
Why for fifty-three years I've put up with it now!
Then he got an idea! An awful idea!
The Grinch got a wonderful, awful idea!
Then he slid down the chimney, a rather tight pinch.
But if Santa could do it, then so could the Grinch.
Every Who down in Whoville, the tall and the small,
Was singing without any presents at all!
And what happened then? Well, in Whoville they say
That the Grinch's small heart grew three sizes that day!
Welcome Christmas while we stand
Heart to heart and hand in hand.","every who down in whoville liked christmas a lot

If Proof could see me now, I know he'd be proud
Somewhere in me deep down, there's something in me he found
That made him believe in me, now no one can beat me now
So y'all can just get to bloggin' about bologna
I'm not gonna stop, the saga continues, no stoppin' the force, Obi
-E-R, just Blaze and me, we are knockin' on doors and no, we
Careful what you say, there ain't no punks over here, so follow me
Through the fog like I'm S-N-double-O-P, let me guide you through the smoke, G
I miss the days of old, thinkin' about you
For you I wanna write the sickest rhyme of my life
Guess that the best thing I can do right now, Doody, for you is to rap
But they'll never catch up to all this energy that I've mustered
So God, just help me out while I fight through this grievin' process
Tryna process this loss is makin' me nauseous
But this depression ain't takin' me hostage,
And I'ma show 'em, blow 'em out the water, slaughter 'em, homes
I'ma own so many belts, only place they can hit me is below 'em
You gave me a reason to fight, I was on my way to see you
You told me, ""Naw, Doody, you're not!""; layin' on that table, I knew
I was gonna make it; soon as you said, ""Think of Hailie"" I knew
There wasn't no way that I was ever gonna leave them babies;
and Proof
Not many are lucky enough to have a guardian angel like you
Lord, I'm so thankful, please don't think that I don't feel grateful, I do

All that peace and that unity
All that weak shit'll ruin me, fuck 'em, yeah
'Cause niggas started talkin' to me like I'm slowin' down
Opinions over statistics, of course
Gassed off journalistic
Come at me and all you'll get is the ballistic report
Booked a private room at Wally's, waiter twistin' the cork
I got multi-colored rings like the Olympics, of course
At award shows, cuttin' through the tension, of course
Girls huggin' me then askin' me, ""What scent that is, boy?""
I be walkin' around the Six like I invented it, boy
Yeah, who am I? The do or die
The one with the fewest lies and the truest ties
They try to compare us, but
Like a job straight outta high school there's no you and I
I taught you everything you know, now you got student pride
All factual, I call the house ""the embassy""
The studio ""the chapel"", I hate to travel
I just pulled up on Solána show, the girl's a natural
I knew her way back when Hollywood was international
Yeah, the furthest I've been, that's word to my ends
Word to the flags that belong in the hood of my Benz
Very presidential, I broke all the codes for zonin' in my residential
I broke spirits that I never meant to
My body isn't much of a sacred temple, with vodka and wine
And sleep at the opposite times
Promise shit is gettin' outta line like when you make a stencil
Or gettin' outta line like when you break a pencil
Violatin' the Treaty of Versailles
Champagne is the alias, but no cease and desist in I
I refuse to comply with regulations
I listen to heavy metal for meditation, no silence
Like Sanders on the Detroit Lions
Get a run around and I'll bury you where they won't find ya
Motor City Casino, I'm at the cage with my old license
They tell me ""don't worry, I got your money"" like Osirus
(I'm the Osiris of this shit)
Dirty 30, workin' on me
Tired of women that may tag me in pictures airin' my dirty laundry
Catering is from Giorgio Baldi, Robyn's favorite
Shit is nice, but I prefer Madeo
Calamari rings and tomato
I got the sauce and now shorties keep claimin' preggo
Wakin' up at 6 p.m. like, ""Where does the day go?""
Forecastin' tornadoes, brainstormin' retaliation at dinner tables
2010 was when I lost my halo
2017 I lost a J. Lo
A Rotterdam trip had me on front page though
I had to lay low, Hot Topic like your everyday clothes
Closed off but I could never stay closed
Billboard awards, I claimed 13 out in Vegas like Sureños
Black excellence, but I guess when it comes to me it's not the same though, all goodie
That just pushed me to do the things we all couldn't
Niggas stakin' out the crib, it's all gravy
Protection that God gave me
Shit is complex like short niggas 'round tall ladies
I gotta watch who I'm talkin' to like it's all-ages
I've seen buddin' careers turn to sit around and talk about other careers, judgin' their peers
Knowledge from niggas who did not contribute to none of this here
my security government tier
advance the venue so we know the exits
Tell 'em I don't wanna link like a broken necklace
I'll be in better company with my own reflection
Mirror, mirror, on the ceiling of my suite in the Royal Palace
The TV playin' Al Jazeera
Insha'Allah, I hope the mission keeps on gettin' clearer
Whenever, wherever, OVO will always be together like Shakira","diplomatic immunity fuck them

Then it hit me like a flash
What if high school went away instead?
Those assholes are the key
They're keeping you away from me
They made you blind, messed up your mind
But I can set you free
You left me and I fell apart
I punched the wall and cried
Bam, bam, bam
Then I found you changed my heart
And set loose all that truthful shit inside
And so I built a bomb
Tonight, our school is Vietnam
Let's
guarantee
they never see their senior prom
I was meant to be yours
We were meant to be one
Don't give up on me now
Finish what we've begun
I was meant to be yours
So when the high school gym goes ""boom""
With everyone inside
Pkhw, pkhw, pkhw
In the rubble of their tomb
We'll plant this note explaining why they died
We, the students of Westerberg High, will die
Our burned bodies may finally get through to you
Your society churns out slaves and blanks, no thanks
Signed, the students of Westerberg High
Goodbye
Bring marshmallows, we'll make s'mores
We can smile and cuddle while the fire roars
I was meant to be yours (
Ah, meant to be yours
)
We were meant to be one (
Ah, meant to be one
)
I can't make it alone (
Ah, make it alone
)
Finish what we've begun
You were meant to be mine
I am all that you need
You carved open my heart
Can't just leave me to bleed
Veronica

And I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord
Can you feel it coming in the air tonight? Oh Lord, oh Lord
Well, if you told me you were drowning

I've seen your face before, my friend
But I don't know if you know who I am
Well, I was there and I saw what you did
I saw it with my own two eyes
So you can wipe off that grin, I know where you've been

And I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord
Well, I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord

And I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord, oh Lord

Who is K. Dot?
A young nigga from Compton, on the curb writing raps next to a gunshot
On the corners where the gangsters and the killers dwell
Everyone I knew was either Crip or Piru
Cousins in elementary, relatives in high school
I needed survival
Got jumped, got jacked, shot at, shot back
They'll kill you if you kill me – it gets deep, nigga

I was walking from Centennial
When an unidentified vehicle
Rolled up
And I was like ""Hol' up""

""Where you stay?""
Westside, that's a Piru gang, to be exact
Well aware they had blue across they hat
Dropped backpack and ran inside of the cul-de-sac

And the minivans where the fan never on
'Cause it's hotter than a lunatic's underarms, in a straight jacket

Yeah
Yeah, yeah, um
(What?) Yeah
('Sup?) Well
You could have the world in the palm of your hands
You still might drop it
And everybody wanna reach inside your pockets
I tell 'em, ""Red light, stop it""
Shit, that give me more headaches than alcoholics
There was nothin' in my wallet, just a lot of dreamin'
I built a crib on top o' the Promised Land, we'll call it even, hmm
I bring more flavor than all the seasons
Winter, spring, summer, fall
The grass is always greener 'til I cut it all
Please leave me to my studies, I give you no applause
My hands been countin' money, and it's hard to be the boss
Often with the bullshit, and, baby, I been through it
Enough for the both of us
So come over later and we won't let no one close to us
We could be posted up

Part I
]
It's like I'm in the dirt, diggin' up old hurt
Tried everything to get my mind off you, it won't work
All it takes is one song on the radio, you're
Right back on it,
reminding me all over again how you fuckin' just brushed me off and left me so burnt
Spent a lot of time tryna soul search
For the way that you turned your back on me
Just when I may have needed you most
You could just close the
Chapter and go about your life like it was nothing
You ruined mine, but you seem to be doin' fine
Well, I've never recovered
But tonight, bet you that what you're
Can't think of a better way to define poetic justice
Mind saying, ""Let it go, fuck this!""
Heart's saying, ""I will, once I bury this bitch alive
Hide the shovel and then drive off in the sunset""
I flee the scene (The scene) like it was my last ride
You see right through (Right through)
Oh, you had me pegged the first time
You can see the truth (The truth)
But it's easier to justify what's bad is good
And I hate to be the bad guy (The bad guy)
I just hate to be the bad guy (The bad guy)
Follow me (Follow me), I ruh-uh-un, follow me, I ruh-uh-un
I just hate to be the bad–
And to think I used to think you was the shit, bitch
To think it was you at one time I worshipped? Shit
Finish this stitch, so you can reap what you sew,
nitwit
You left our family in shambles
You expect me to just get over him, pretend he never existed?
May be gone but he's not forgotten
And don't think 'cause he's been out the picture so long that I've stopped the plotting and still ain't coming to get ya
You're wrong and that shit was rotten
And the way you played him's same shit you did to me, cold
Feelings I harbor? All this pent-up resentment I hold on to?
Letters, you don't respond to 'em
Fuck it, I'm coming to see you
And gee, who better to talk to than you?
Poof, then I'm gone, voosh
I flee the scene (The scene) like it was my last ride
You see right through (Right through)
Oh, you had me pegged the first time
You can see the truth (The truth)
But it's easier to justify what's bad is good
And I hate to be the bad guy (The bad guy)
I just hate to be the bad guy (The bad guy)
Follow me (Follow me), I ruh-uh-un, follow me, I ruh-uh-un
I just hate to be the bad guy
I've been drivin' around your side of this town
Like nine frickin' hours and forty-five minutes now
Feel like I've been waitin' on this moment all of my life
Such a disappointment I had to make this appointment
To come and see ya, but I ain't here for your empathy
I don't need your apology or your friendship or sympathy
It's revenge that I seek
So I sneak vengefully, and treat your bedroom window
Like I reach my full potential—I peeked (Haha)
Continue to peep, still bent low, then keep
Tapping the glass lightly then start to crescendo, sneak
All the way 'round to the back porch
Man, door handles unlocked, shouldn't be that easy to do this
You don't plan for intruders beforehand?
Surprised to see me? Cat got your tongue?
Gag, chloroform rag, dag, almost hack-up a lung
Like you picked an axe up and swung, stick to the core plan
Dragged to the back of a trunk by one of your fans
Irony's spectacular, huh?
Now who's a faggot, you punk?
And here's your Bronco hat, you can have that shit back 'cause they suck
It's just me, you, and the music now, Slim, I hope you hear it
We're in a car right now—
wait, here comes my favorite lyric
""I'm the bad guy who makes fun of people that die""
And hey, here's a sequel to my Mathers LP just to try to get people to buy
How's this for a publicity stunt? This should be fun
Last album now 'cause after this you'll be officially done
Eminem killed by M and M, Matthew Mitchell
Bitch, I even have your initials
I initially was gonna bury you next to my brother, but fuck it
Since you're in love with your city so much, I figured, what the fuck, the best place you could be buried alive is right here
Two more exits, time is quite near
That sirens I hear?
Guess ninety on the freeway wasn't the brightest idea
As cops appear in my driver's side mirror
Hope Foxtrot gets an aerial shot of your burial plot, at least
New plan, Stan!
Slim: ""Chauvinist pig drove in this big Lincoln Town Car""
Well, gotta go, almost at the bridge
Ha ha, big bro, it's for you; Slim, this is for him
And Frank Ocean; oh, hope you can swim good
Now say you hate homos again

Part II

I also represent anyone on the receiving end of those jokes you offend
I'm the nightmare you fell asleep and then woke up still in
I'm your karma closin' in with each stroke of a pen
Perfect time to have some remorse to show for your sin
Nope, it's hopeless, I'm that denial that you're hopelessly in
When they say all of this is approaching its end
But you refuse to believe that it's over, here we go all over again
Back's to the wall, I'm stackin' up all them odds
I am your lack of a conscience
I'm the ringing in your ears
I'm the polyps on the back of your tonsils
Eating your vocal cords after your concerts
I'm your time that's almost up that you haven't acknowledged
Grab for some water
But I'm that pill that's too jagged to swallow
I'm the bullies you hate that you became with every faggot you slaughtered comin' back on ya
Every woman you insult, batter, but the double-standard you have when it comes to your daughters
'Cause Marshall Mathers, the rapper's persona
Is half a facade,
and Matthew and Stan's just symbolic
Of you not knowin' what you had 'til it's gone
'Cause after all the glitz and the glam
No more fans that are calling your name
Cameras are off, sad, but it happens to all of them
When it's time to walk away, I'm every guilt trip
The baggage you have, but as you gather up all your possessions
If there's anything you have left to say
'Less it makes an impact then don't bother
So 'fore you rest your case better make sure you're packing a wallop (A wallop)
So, one last time, I'm back
'Fore it fades into black and it's all over
Tryna recapture that lightning trapped in a bottle
Tragic portrait of an artist tortured
Trapped in his own drawings
Tap into thoughts blacker and darker than anything imaginable;
Uh, as we pick up where the last Mathers left off","

328,Do Ya Thing,Gorillaz,2012,261885,https://genius.com/Gorillaz-Do-Ya-Thing-lyrics,"I'm a pale imitator of a boy in the sky
With a cap in his head and a knot in his tie
I'm the light in the mall when the power is gone
A shadow in the corner, just playing along
I'm only laying in my bed, I'm rolling aside
But if I get a car, I'm hoping to ride
Because I know if I ever say ""I'm leaving"" to you
You've got a folding chair, and you don't know what to do
You'd sigh
You wanna do it, but you don't know what you're doing, baby (A-a-a-a-aah)
You wanna feel it but you don't know what you're feeling tonight (Alright, how are we doing?)
And if you're thinking that I don't know what you're thinking, baby (A-a-a-a-aah)
You do more thinking and I'll go out and make it alright (Alright, how do you do?)
I’m impregnable,
You wanna do it, but you don't know what you're doing, baby (A-a-a-a-aah)

Quit acting like you don't wanna be here
Fuck around and get jumped like leap year
Glock in the glove make you really wanna leave me, alone
Get the fuck on, gone
Okay, okay, okay, back to the happy song
Rap ain't nothing but the art of talkin' shit
My girl look pretty up there riding dick
My plaid past,
my solid future
Asinine ass and a gorgeous coochie
I'm an OutKast but you're into me
Summer got mad 'cause winter blew me
That Juicy Fruit, that splooshy sploosh

Everybody hit the floor, we through the roof

How come it be, some lame ass nigga talking about

But y'all rap a lot and I'm like ""Wrap it up, hoe""
You ain't Scarface,
you ain't Willie D
You ain't Bushwick, you ain't killin' me
Better play with your motherfucking momma
Keep sleeping on me, I'mma rock my pajamas
How come blacks don't play baseball?
Y'all white, know y'all can taste all

Down to the garden, took a little dip (
Oh no
)
Apple juice falling from her lips, took a little sip
Lil' sip, took a lil' sip
Took a lil' sip, t-took a lil', took a lil', took a lil' sip
Ayo, I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
Where niggas hold TECs like they mad at the ref
That's why I keep a cross on my chest, either that or a vest
Do you believe that Eve had Adam in check?
And if so, you gotta expect
To sip juice from the forbidden fruit and get loose
Cole is the king, most definite
My little black book thicker than the Old Testament
Niggas pay for head but the pussy sold separate
Same bitch giving brains to the minister
The same reason they call Mr. Cee the finisher
Forbidden fruit, watch for the Adam's apple
What you eat don't make me shit and who you fuck don't make me cum
Put a price on my head won't make me run
Try to kill me but it can't be done
'Cause my words gon' live forever
You put two and two together Cole here forever
Me and my bitch, took a little trip
Down to the garden, took a little dip (Oh no)
Apple juice falling from her lips, took a little sip
Just copped a maroon 5, no Adam Levine
'Came a man by myself, only father was time
I know that she relate baby daddy ain't shit
So she raised that nigga kids but she swallowing mine
All on my line like caller number nine
'Cause a nigga poppin' like Harlem in the nine-seven
Way before Mase was a reverend
I was a young nigga making A's at 11
Or 12, trying to get a taste of the Heaven
Or Hell, only time gon' tell
Fuck her while her mama home, ""baby, don't yell""
How many records do a nigga gotta sell
Just to get the cover of the XXL
Or Fader, fuck your magazine hater
When I say that I'm the greatest I ain't talking about later
I'ma drop the album same day as Kanye
Just to show the Boyz the man now like Wanyá
But this what's next, the boy sick, can't disinfect
Life's a bitch and her pussy's wet
My clip is loaded and this is the kiss of... death
Blaow
Me and my bitch, took a little trip
Down to the garden, took a little dip (Oh no)
Apple juice falling from her lips took a little sip
Don't shit last, don't shit last and you know that
Went to hell, got hot didn't melt
The only man above me is God himself
All these other niggas is below me

Started with a dollar and a dream, and you know that

342,When the Music Stops,Eminem,2002,430496,https://genius.com/Eminem-When-the-Music-Stops-lyrics,"Music, reality: sometimes it's hard to tell the difference
But we as entertainers have a responsibility to these kids
Psych!
If I were to die, murdered in cold blood tomorrow
Would you feel sorrow, show love, or would it matter?
Could never be the lead-off batter
If there ain't shit for me to feed off, I'm see-saw battlin'
But there's way too much at stake for me to be fake
There's too much on my plate
I done came way too far in this game to turn and walk away
And not say what I got to say
What the fuck you take me for, a joke? You smokin' crack?
'Fore I do that, I'd beg Mariah to take me back
I'll get up 'fore I get down, run myself in the ground
'Fore I put some wack shit out
I'm tryna smack this one out the park, five-thousand mark
Y'all steady tryna drown a shark
Ain't gon' do nothin' but piss me off
Fuck shootin', I'm just tryna knock his teeth out
Fuck with me now, bitch, let's see you freestyle
Talk is cheap
Motherfucker, if you really feelin' froggish, leap
""Yo, Slim, you gon' let him get away with that?
He tried to play you, you can't let him escape with that""
Man, I hate this crap
This ain't rap, this is crazy, the way we act
When we confuse hip-hop with real life when the music stops
The only way I'm leavin' this bitch is suicide
Arrived back at my enemy's crib with Hennessy
I spark willingly, with a Dillinger in the dark, diligently
(Bah)
I'll murder you, I gauge and have me turn into
A mad man, Son of Sam, bitch,
I'm surgical
I was happy havin' a deal at first
And you ain't got nothin' left but your word and your balls
Checkin' for your record when it's sellin'
When it ain't, that's the end: no laughs, no friends
No girls, just the gin you drink 'til your car spin
You think, ""Damn!""
Let's see how many of your men loyal
When I pull up lookin' for you with a pistol sippin' a can of Pennzoil
I'm revved up; who said what when lead bust?
You hype poppin' shit in broad daylight, nigga, you're a goner at night
Instigators
Proof, nigga, I'm a wolf
Get your whole roof caved in like reindeer hooves
It's Hill Street, this is hardcore blues
Put a gun to rap, check in all our dues, nigga
Or make the news, bet you all y'all move
When the Uzi pop, you better drop when the music stop
Music has changed my life in so many ways
Brain's confused, been fucked since the 5th grade
LL told me to rock the bells
N.W.A said ""Fuck tha Police,"" now I'm in jail
'93 was strictly R&B
Fucked up haircut, listened to Jodeci
Michael Jackson, who gon' tell me I ain't Mike?
Ass cheeks painted white, fuckin' Priscilla tonight
Transvestite in the front, Eddie Murphy in the back
M.O.P.
Marilyn Manson, I dyed my hair blue and grew some titties

Your hijo pequeño, my nachos bel grande
Stay sippin' that André, spent three stacks, that's André
That Balmain, that Phillip Lim, they say I'm dressing like Kanye
I'm everything that my rhymes say: breadwinner, brand owner
Play Cloths, millionaire, trendsetter, landowner
D-Boys still ball the same, just gotta little bit of glam on it
I let Ja Rule when I murder ink
Murder pink, murder what you thought and what you think
This Queens prodigy is the product of what you ain't
Tell HudMo Dope says, ""What's up?""
Go Dreamer's a looney (Uh)
Wish upon a star (So what's up?)
This that Category 5, this that quake, bitch, that quake, bitch
In Polo I'm stylin', it's all that I'm rockin'
Used to have a nigga that was down to get to clappin'
Seen it on a video, he yappin' to the captain
50 dollar, hundred dollar bill nigga shit
Got Mary blowing Jane
Diamond lane running thangs ain't shit you can tell us (Don't tell us nothing)
Just copped more .4 5's and 9's and I ain't talking bout no J's
That one nigga that Kendrick can't control (What)
Problem
(Check!)
Move the brown squares like Wheat Thins
Y'all five days and a weekend
Stay smokin' on that defense
That's two or three and I'm zonin'
Rap game Peter Parker, web swinging through the air
I'm silencin' lambs and sheep, don't sleep
'Cause my characteristics are that of a cannibal
Call this shit Hannibal Lecter
I grew up in the city where they figured they can kill dreams when they kill King
In the school of hard knocks I'm a fuckin' grad
In these Pumas I'ma run shit, high so I'm above shit
A Bathing Ape trucker, I'm a fly mothafucka
Remember I was shoppin' at Family Dollar
My hearse a 72442 with an all wood wheel and that bitch'll vert
My Oldmobile is a cold mobile
Niggas tryna get a brick of Kathy Lee Gifford
I'm kickin' it, I'm Liu Kang
I'm gangbanging 'til I break my fingers
'Til all my family members speak the slanguage
I ain't even drop no album yet
Off mixtapes, that's how I've been maintaining
Lyrically I am the epitome of a real MC
Biblically I am Timothy,
visually I am Tripoli
Full of bigotry, fighting with Gaddafi over liberty
sipping Hennessy
That's my only vice, old school noisy pipes
I ain't tryna be the richest, I'm cool with an M like Obie Trice
A one-hit wonder to your girl 'cause I came and went
The best thing to happen to the street since the sidewalk
Or the stop sign,
She ride three deep with molly in the middle
Put Micky Thompsons all on my Jeep
Her posse beat me by the threes, I call 'em Reggie Miller
She down with Slime, she got a tattoo of an anaconda
I'm cooking the Hannah Montana-na
I kill every one of my features, I spend all my money on divas
Bust it, in these Space Jams, I'm a Monstar
I'm on point like the state building
I stay sharper than razor blades
CUZ Lightyear
Lookin' like a fashion fossil, I'm Gianni reborn
When I smile for the photo looking like Lobo
Me and my bloodshot eyes, I pass on the Bud Light Lime
Just pass me that brew of St. Ides
Heat up on the holster, World's Fair! Yeah, you know us
11-36-8 be the zip code
Corona, Queens, nigga, that's what I call home
Ugh, ugh, got those motherfucking custom Roshes, feel me?
Swing the Dodge Viper lefty like I'm Randy Johnson
My mother wrist so cut look like it got bit by a grizzly
And these drugs got me spinning like some Capoeira
Still rock the slow beats with gold teeth, ain't afraid to hold heat
It's me
I built a fucking blueprint, like who the fuck you kidding?
You lames and you fall, I'm like 2 Chainz when I ball
Got Husseins on my feet and Husains on my wall
Hussein Chalayans, a pretty girl said that's fancy
hot as fuck, creme brûlée
King Midas, I can make gold with a touch
I promise to kill them all 'til everybody's missed
I'm from the Old New York
Where you got your chain snatched and your kicks tooken
Feared the sensei
I'm 7.0in' on Pitchfork
Tell Bron Bron we can bring the Heat back

Wish I was Jigga man, carefree livin'
But I'm not Shawn or Martin Louis
I'm that Cleveland nigga rollin' with them Brooklyn boys
I control my own life, Charles was never in charge
No sitcom could teach Scott about the dram'
Or even explain the troubles that haunted my mom
On Christmas time, my mom Christmas grind
Got me most of what I wanted, how'd you do it, Mom, huh?
She copped the toys I would play with in my room by myself
""Why he by himself?""
He got two older brothers; one hood, one good
An independent older sister kept me fly when she could
But they all didn't see
The little bit of sadness in me
Scotty
I've got some issues that nobody can see
And all of these emotions are pouring out of me
I bring them to the light for you, it's only right
This is the soundtrack to my life, the soundtrack to my life
I'm super paranoid, like a sixth sense
Since my father died, I ain't been right since
And I tried to piece the puzzle of the universe
Split an eighth of shrooms just so I could see the universe
I try and think about myself as a sacrifice
Just to show the kids they ain't the only ones who up at night
The moon will illuminate my room
And soon, I'm consumed by my doom
Once upon a time, nobody gave a fuck
It's all said and done and my cock's been sucked
So now I'm in the cut, alcohol in the wound
My heart's an open sore that I hope heals soon
I live in a cocoon opposite of Cancún
Where it is never sunny, the dark side of the moon
So it's more than right, I try and shed some light on a man
Not many people of this planet understand, fam
I've got some issues that nobody can see
And all of these emotions are pouring out of me
I bring 'em to the light for you, it's only right
This is the soundtrack to my life, the soundtrack to my life
I'm this close to go and trying some coke
And a happy ending would be slittin' my throat
Ignorance to cope, man, ignorance is bliss
Ignorance is love and I need that shit
If I never did shows then I'd prolly be a myth
If I cared about the blogs then I'd prolly be a jackass
fam
Haters shake my hand but I keep the sanitizer on deck
Hope I really get to see 30
Most of the clean faces be the most dirty
brain is insanity
Only things that calm me down; pussy, and some Cali tree
I am happy, that's just the saddest lie
I've got some issues that nobody can see
And all of these emotions are pouring out of me

And if I do, I don't sense the truth in 'em
Distancing myself while I'm focusing, fo-focusing
As I shine on and dream on, our vibes are on
Had one trip of a dream back in 2003
Who am I? And who will I be? Will I be free?
I need a sign, oh I need a sign

With a prosthetic arm and smellin' like Boone's Farm
A lush that love to drink, drunk-drivin' a tank
Rollin' over a bank, cops see me and faint

Malice Greening them
right when your wife's lookin'
If I could capture the rage of today's youth and bottle it
Crush the glass with my bare hands and swallow it

You Liberaces, Versaces, and you Nazis
Watch me, 'cause you figured you got me in this hot seat
You motherfuckers wanna judge me 'cause you're not me
You'll never stop me, I'm top speed and you pop me
I came to save these new generations of babies
From parents who failed to raise them 'cause they're lazy
To grow to praise me, I'm makin' them go crazy

pro'bly make a gay nigga reconsider
You're now rockin' with the best, mane, dress game down to the sex game
Won't brag, but the boy been blessed, mane
let you play with the stick; Ovechkin
She callin', she textin', she's fallin', but let me explain
Gotta tell your old boyfriend skate, girl, 'cause a nigga don't play them ex games
Nope, straight sexing, no handcuff or arresting
And I ain't coming off of my last name, 'cause I really can't take no stressing
'Bout where I done been, who I done hit, your homegirl saying, ""He a bad boy""
But I'm signed to the Roc, no time for the gossip, bitch, put down them tabloids

""I heard you got a main chick, a mistress and some hoes
You be up to no good and everybody knows
My homegirls tried to warn me, they tried to let me know
But what you got I need a lot, so I can't let you go""

and I got love for the underground
Kweli, Pimp C, H-Town where Bun get down
Met a bad bitch that'll cut all night, that'll suck all night, you just cut off lights
Almost missed my flight, tryna get my last little nut, all right?
She be down for whatever whenever I wanna get up in the guts, all right?
on the grind, tryna find this lettuce
I love it when you give me head, I hate it when you give me headaches

Eminem
]
(""What's your name?"")
Marshall
(""Who's your daddy?"")
I don't have one
My mother reproduced like the komodo dragon
then crashed in
The side of loco-motive with rap, I'm
Loco,
Michelangelo with a paint gun in a tantrum
'Bout to explode all over the canvas
Back with the Yoda of rap, ""In a spasm
Your music usually has 'em
Follow you must, Rick Rubin my little Padawan.""
Probably find a way to complain about a Picasso painting
Puke Skywalker,
but sound like Chewbacca when I talk
Full of such blind rage, I need a seein' eye dog
Can't even find the page I was writing this rhyme on
Oh, it's on the ram-page
Couldn't see what I wrote, I write small
It says, ""Ever since I drove a '79 Lincoln with whitewalls
Had a fire in my heart
And a dire desire to aspire
to Die Hard.""
So as long as I'm on the clock, punching this time card
Hip-hop ain't dying on my watch
Now sometimes when I'm sleepin'
She comes to me in my dreams
(""Who's your daddy?"")
I don’t know him, but I wonder—
(""Is he rich like me?"")
Ha
Makes you want to get up and start dancin'
Even if it is Charles Manson
blue lights flashin'
Laughin' all the way to the bank, lampin' in my K-Mart mansion
I’m in the style department
With a pile in my cart, rippin' the aisle apart but
With great power comes
Absolutely no responsibility
for content
Completely despondent and condescending
The king of nonsense and controversy
Rebel without a cause
(""Hip-hop is the Devil's music"")
Does that mean it belongs to me?
'Cause I just happen to be a white honky devil with two horns
That don't honk but every time I speak you hear a beep
But lyrically I never hear a peep, not even a whisper
Rappers better stay clear of me, bitch, 'cause it's the—
My job here isn't done
(""What's your name?"")
Shady
(""Who's your daddy?"")
I don’t give a fuck, but I wonder
(""Is he rich like me?"")
Doubt it, ha
(""Has he taken any time to show you what you need to live?"")
But I bet we wouldn't probably get one block
Without me knocking your block off,
Maybe that's why I'm so bananas I appealed to all those walks
Of life, whoever had strife
Maybe that's what dad and son talks are like
'Cause I related to the struggles of young America
When their fucking parents were unaware of their troubles
I chuckle as everybody bloodies their bare knuckles
The sign of my hustle says:
""Don't knock”, the door's broken, it won't lock
It might just fly open, get cold-cocked
You critics come to pay me a visit?
Misery loves company, please stay a minute
Kryptonite to a hypocrite
Zip your lip if you dish it but can't take it
Too busy gettin' stoned in your glass house
To kick rocks,
Completely brain-dead: Rain Man
Doing a Bankhead in a restraint chair
So, bitch, shoot me a look, it better be a blank stare
Or get shanked in the pancreas
I'm angrier than all eight other reindeer
Put together with Chief Keef 'cause I hate every fuckin' thang, yeah
But I still am a ""Criminal""
The last
Mathers LP
 done went diamond
This time I'm predicting that this one will go emerald (Hehe)
The only message that I have to send
Is: ""Dad, I'm back at it again""

381,Moment of Truth,Gang Starr,1998,407348,https://genius.com/Gang-Starr-Moment-of-Truth-lyrics,"[Intro: Sharon]
No matter what we face
We must face the moment of truth, baby
They say it's lonely at the top, and whatever you do –
The same sheisty cats that you hang with, and do your thang with
Could set you up and wet you up, nigga, peep the language
You know I be the master of the who, what, where, and why
See when you're shining, some chumps'll wanna dull ya
Always selfish, jealous punks will wanna pull ya–
Down, just like some shellfish in a bucket
'Cause they love it, to see your ass squirm like a worm
That everyone must meet their moment of truth
Sometimes you gotta dig deep, when problems come near
Don't fear, things get severe for everybody, everywhere
Why do bad things happen to good people?
To think such problems can arise from minor confrontations
Don't even feel like drinkin' or even gettin' high
'Cause all that's gonna do really, is accelerate–
The anxieties that I wish I could alleviate
But, wait – I've been through a whole lot of other shit before
So, I oughta be able to withstand some more
But, I'm sweatin' though, my eyes are turnin' red and yo –
I'm ready to lose my mind, but instead, I use my mind
I put down the knife, and take the bullets out my 9
My only crime–was that I'm too damn kind
And now some scandalous motherfuckers wanna take what's mine
So like they say, every dog has its day
And like they say, God works in a mysterious way
""You shall know truth, and the truth shall set you free!""
Yo, I got one lyric pointed at your head, for start
Another one–is pointed at your weak-ass heart
Now if I pull the trigger, on these fully-loaded lines
You're gonna wish I would've pulled a black 9
Revolvin' on the TASCAM, much doper than my last jam
While others struggle to juggle tricky metaphors
I explore more, to expose the core
You dig it and you dug it, 'cause like money you love it
Throw up your He Allah Now, Divine Saviors
No pager, no celly, no drop-top Benz-y
I came to bring your phony hip-hop to an ending
My art of war will leave you sore from the abuse","intro sharon

382,American Pie,Don McLean,1971,2445423,https://genius.com/Don-McLean-American-Pie-lyrics,"A long, long time ago
I can still remember how that music
Used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance
That I could make those people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while
But February made me shiver
With every paper I'd deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step
I can't remember if I cried
When I read about his widowed bride
But something touched me deep inside
The day the music died
So, bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
And them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin', ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""
Did you write the book of love?
And do you have faith in God above
If the Bible tells you so?
Now, do you believe in rock 'n' roll?
Can music save your mortal soul?
And can you teach me how to dance real slow?
Well, I know that you're in love with him
'Cause I saw you dancin' in the gym
You both kicked off your shoes
Man, I dig those rhythm and blues
I was a lonely teenage broncin' buck
With a pink carnation and a pickup truck
But I knew I was out of luck
The day the music died
I started singin', bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin', ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""
Now, for ten years we've been on our own
And moss grows fat on a rollin' stone
But that's not how it used to be
When the jester sang for the king and queen
In a coat he borrowed from James Dean
And a voice that came from you and me
Oh, and while the king was looking down
The jester stole his thorny crown
The courtroom was adjourned
No verdict was returned
And while Lenin read a book on Marx
The quartet practiced in the park
And we sang dirges in the dark
The day the music died
We were singin', bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin', ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""
Helter skelter in a summer swelter
The birds flew off with a fallout shelter
Eight miles high and fallin' fast
It landed foul on the grass
The players tried for a forward pass
With the jester on the sidelines in a cast
Now, the halftime air was sweet perfume
While sergeants played a marching tune
We all got up to dance
Oh, but we never got the chance
'Cause the players tried to take the field
The marching band refused to yield
Do you recall what was revealed
The day the music died?
We started singin', bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin', ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""
Oh, and there we were all in one place
A generation lost in space
With no time left to start again
So, come on, Jack be nimble, Jack be quick
Jack Flash sat on a candlestick
'Cause fire is the Devil's only friend
Oh, and as I watched him on the stage
My hands were clenched in fists of rage
No angel born in Hell
Could break that Satan spell
And as the flames climbed high into the night
To light the sacrificial rite
I saw Satan laughing with delight
The day the music died
He was singin', bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee, but the levee was dry
Them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
And singin', ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""
I met a girl who sang the blues
And I asked her for some happy news
But she just smiled and turned away
I went down to the sacred store
Where I'd heard the music years before
But the man there said the music wouldn't play
And in the streets, the children screamed
The lovers cried and the poets dreamed
But not a word was spoken
The church bells all were broken
And the three men I admire most
The Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost
They caught the last train for the coast
The day the music died
And there I stood alone and afraid
I dropped to my knees and there I prayed
And I promised Him everything I could give
If only He would make the music live
And He promised it would live once more
But this time one would equal four
And in five years four had come to mourn
And the music was reborn
And they were singin', bye-bye, Miss American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ol' boys were drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin', ""This'll be the day that I die
This'll be the day that I die""

Some said Quest was wack, but now is that the case?
So, Shaheed, come in with the sugar cuts
Phife Dawg's my name, but on stage call me Dynomutt
I roll with Shaheed and the brother Abstract
I never let a statue tell me how nice I am
Comin' with more hits than the Braves and the Yankees
Livin' mad phat like an oversized mampi
The wackest crews try to diss, it makes me laugh
When my track record's longer than a DC-20 aircraft
Make somethin' def or take that garbage to St. Elsewhere

Plus, congratulations, you know you got a son
I heard he looks like ya, why don't your lady write ya?
Told her she should visit, that's when she got hyper
Flippin', talkin' about he acts too rough
He didn't listen, he be riffin' while I'm tellin' him stuff
I was like, ""Yeah,"" shorty don't care, she a snake too
Fuckin' with them niggas from that fake crew that hate you
But yo, guess who got shot in the dome-piece?
Jerome's niece, on her way home from Jones Beach
plus little Rob is sellin' drugs on the dime
Hangin' out with young thugs that all carry nines
And night time is more trife than ever
What up with Cormega? Did you see him? Are y'all together?
Say what's up to Herb, Ice and Bullet
I left a half a hundred in your commissary
Dear Born, you'll be out soon, stay strong
Hold, check out the story yesterday when I was walkin'
That nigga you shot last year tried to appear like he hurtin' somethin'
Word to mother, I heard him frontin'
And he be pumpin' on your block, your man gave him your Glock
And now they run together — what up, son? Whatever
But I heard you blew a nigga with a ox for the phone piece
Wildin' on the Island, but now in Elmira
Better chill, 'cause them niggas will put that ass on fire
Last time you wrote, you said they tried you in the showers
But maintain, when you come home, the corner's ours
But chill, see you on the next V.I
I gave your mom dukes loot for kicks, plus sent you flicks
Your brother's buckwildin' in 4-Main, he wrote me
I hate it when your moms cries
It kinda makes me want to murder, for real-a
I even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs, but one love
Sometimes I sit back with a Buddha sack
Mind's in another world, thinkin', ""How can we exist through the facts?""
Written in school textbooks, bibles, et cetera
Fuck a school lecture, the lies get me vexed-er
So I be ghost from my projects
I take my pen and pad for the weekend, hittin' L's while I'm sleepin'
A two-day stay, you may say I needed time alone
To relax my dome, no phone, left the nine at home
You see the streets had me stressed somethin' terrible
Fuckin' with them corners have a nigga up in Bellevue
Or HDM, hit with numbers from eight to ten
A future in a maximum state pen is grim
So I comes back home, nobody's out but Shorty Doo-Wop
Rollin' two phillies together, in the 'Bridge, we call 'em ""oo-wops""
He inhaled so deep, shut his eyes like he was 'sleep
Started coughin', one eye peeked to watch me speak
We was chillin' on these benches where he pumped his loose cracks
I took the L when he passed it, this little bastard
Keeps me blasted and starts talkin' mad shit
I had to school him, told him don't let niggas fool him
'Cause when the pistol blows, the one that's murdered be the cool one
Left some jewels in his skull that he can sell if he chose
Words of wisdom from Nas: Try to rise up above
Keep an eye out for Jake, shorty wop, one love","what up kid i know shit is rough doing your bid

the shutters and doors of the radley house were closed on sundays another thing alien to maycombs ways closed doors meant illness and cold weather only
i once asked atticus
domiciled
flivver
using abusive and profane language in the presence and hearing of a female
and mr radleys boy was not seen again for fifteen years
boo radley
a neighborhood scold
who said she knew the whole thing
miss stephanie
tuscaloosa
highstrung
conceded
nebulous
boo would die of mold from the damp
my memory came alive
cannas
leathery man
colorless eyes so colorless they did not reflect light
posture was ramrod straight
pensacola
house died
wear us out
mr radley made his final journey past our house
there goes the meanest man ever god blew breath into murmured calpurnia
mr radley went under boo would come out
the only difference between him and his father was their ages
the more we told dill about the radleys the more he wanted to know
them said he goes out all right when it is pitch dark miss stephanie crawford
his tracks in our back yard many a mornin and one night i heard him scratching
jem gave a reasonable description of boo boo was about sixandahalf feet tall judging from his tracks he dined on raw squirrels and any cats he could catch that is why his hands were bloodstained if you ate an animal raw you could never wash the blood off there was a long jagged scar that ran across his face what teeth he had were yellow and rotten his eyes popped and he drooled most of the time
dill bet jem
the gray ghost
 against two tom swifts
i told jem if he set fire to the radley house i was going to tell atticus on him
he will probably come out after you when he sees you in the yard then scoutn mell jump on him and hold him down till we can tell him we are not going to hurt him
old house was the same droopy and sick","['nearly', 'thirteen', 'brother', 'jem', 'got', 'arm', 'badly', 'broken', 'elbow', 'healed', 'jem', 'fear', 'never', 'able', 'play', 'football', 'assuaged',

398,Fast Lane,Bad Meets Evil,2011,1015406,https://genius.com/Bad-Meets-Evil-Fast-Lane-lyrics,"Uh, first verse, uh, I'm on 'til I'm on an island
My life's ridin' on the autobahn on autopilot
Before I touch dirt or kill y'all with kindness
You've been warned if you've been borned or if you conformed
Slap up a cop and then snatch him out of his uniform
Leave him with his socks, hard bottoms and bloomers on
And hang him by his balls from the horn of a unicorn
Y'all niggas' intellect mad slow, y'all fags know
Claimin' you bangin',
you flamin'
Bet you could light your own cigarette with your asshole
Me and Shady deaded the past, so
That basically resurrected my cashflow
I might rap tight as the snatch of a fat dyke
Though I ain't wrapped tight, my blood type's the 80s
My 90s was like the Navy, you was like the Brady's
You still fly kites daily
Catch me in my Mercedes, bumpin' ""Ice Ice Baby""
Screaming, ""Shady 'til I die!""
Like a half a pair of dice, life's crazy
So I live it to the fullest 'til I'm Swayze
And you only live it once, so I'm thinking 'bout this nice, nice lady
Wait, no, stop me now 'fore I get on a roll (Danish)
Let me tell you what this pretty little dame's name is 'cause she's kinda famous
And I hope that I don't sound too heinous when I say this
Nicki Minaj, but I wanna stick my penis in your anus
You morons think that I'm a genius
Really, I belong inside a dang insane asylum
I am back, and I am razor-sharp, baby
And that's ""back"" with a capital B with an exclamation mark
I wanna rip this mystical slick shit
You don't wanna become another victim, a statistic of this shit
‘Cause after I spit the bullets, I'ma treat these shell casings like a soccer ball
I'ma kick the ballistics;
so get this dick, I'ma live this—
I'm livin' life in the fast lane (Ayy)
Movin' at the speed of life and I can't slow down
Only got a gallon in the gas tank (Oh)
But I'm almost at the finish line, so I can't stop now (Yeah)
I'm livin' life in the fast lane (Pedal to the metal)
I'm livin' life in the fast lane (Pedal to the metal)
At war with a bottle as Captain Morgan attacks my organs (C'mon)
My slow flow is euphoric, it's like I rap endorphins (Woo)
I made a pact with the devil that says
""I'll let you take me,
you let me take a shovel
Dig up the corpse of Jack Kevorkian"" (C'mon)
Go back and forthin', more beef than you can pack a fork in
I'm livin' the life of the infinite enemy, down
My tenement chimney now,
Was called M&M, but he threw away the candy and ate the rapper
Chewed him up, and spitted him out
Fuck the mall, he shuts the whole motherfuckin' Walmart
D-d-down every time he comes a-r-r-round
To the point you don't suck my dick
Then you're gonna get decapitated
Other words, you don't fuckin' give me head
Then I'ma have to take it
To Michael Jackson's activator (
Woo

I give her my heart but she wanted my soul

Where I'm bound, I can't tell
Goodbye's too good a word, babe

My Crips lurking, don't die tonight
I just want to dance with you, baby
Just don't move too fast, I'm too crazy
Man down, Downey Ave, it gets shady
Take a nigga mind off that
We can dip, fuck in the whip, slide right back in the function
One wrong word, start busting
Put that on my Yankee hat
I'm a gangsta Crip, fuck gangsta rap
Where the ladies at? Where the hoes? Where the bitches?
Every real nigga know the difference
Bandana brown like the dope daddy shooting in the kitchen
Real Norfside nigga, never went to Poly, Wilson, or Cabrillo
Cocaine color of a Creole
T-Skrap moving for the D-low, and he know
I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
From the city where the skinny carry strong heat
Norfside, Long Beach (Norfside, Long Beach)
Hit the corner, make a dollar flipping
Split the dollars with my mama children
Folks need Porsches, hoes need abortions
I just need y'all out of my business
Never no problem playing no bitches
Never no problem spraying no witnesses
No face, no case, been with the shit
Hopped out broad day, then emptied clips
Cut class 'cause it wasn't 'bout cash
School wasn't no fun, couldn't bring my gun
Know a change gon' come like Obama 'nem say
But they shooting everyday 'round my mama 'nem way
So we put an AK where Kiana and them stay
And that's for any nigga say he got a problem with me
How I'm Cripping where I'm living, come and follow me
Pistol popping, Poppy Street

I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
I ain't never ran from nothing but the police
From the city where the skinny carry strong heat
Norfside, Long Beach (Norfside, Long Beach)
Nate Dogg still here 'cause of niggas like me
Police still scared 'cause of niggas like me
In the hood, like a dollar sweet tea or a Louis Burger
You ain't with the business, nigga, who you murdered?
You ain't heard of Coldchain? Best thang smokin' out the city
Riding 'round with the same shotgun that shot Ricky
Lil' nigga should've zig-zagged, then he got his back wet
Naughty running Norfside, niggas better fact-check
Fronting with the gun talk, I ain't heard a clap yet
All my niggas from the street, they the niggas best yet
'Cept for Lil' Halftime, brody bang the Five Blocks
Sorry, I hit your homie five times, better grab chalk
Did it, got away with it out the Civic
We Cripping, Long Beach City, pay a visit

Giving hell 'til it's frozen over

Got him
Yo, Dre! Gimme a funky-ass bassline!
Right here!
Here's a little somethin' 'bout a nigga like me
Never should've been let out the penitentiary
Ice Cube would like to say
That I'm a crazy motherfucker from around the way
Since I was a youth, I smoked weed out
Now I'm the motherfucker that you read about
Takin' a life or two, that's what the hell I do
You don't like how I'm livin'? Well, fuck you!
With a right-left, right left ya toothless
And then you say ""Goddamn, they ruthless!""
We don't just say no, we're too busy sayin', ""Yeah!""
About drinkin' straight out the eight bottle
Do I look like a motherfuckin' role model?
To a kid lookin' up to me
Life ain't nothin' but bitches and money
'Cause I'm the type of nigga that's built to last
See, I don't give a fuck, 'cause I keep bellin'
Gangsta! Gangsta! That's what they yellin'
It's not about a salary, it's all about reality
Gangsta! Gangsta!
Hopin' you sophisticated motherfuckers hear what I have to say
Dumb-ass hooker ain't nothin' but a dyke
Takin' niggas out with a flurry of buck shots
It's like this, because of that who-ride
N.W.A is wanted for a homicide
Gangsta! Gangsta! That's what they yellin'
It's not about a salary, it's all about reality
He'll tell you exactly how he feel
And don't hold a fuckin' thing back
See a nigga on Dayton's and we creep
With six niggas in a car; are you crazy?
She was scared, and it was showin'
We all said, ""Fuck you, bitch!"" and kept goin'
A bum rush, but we call it rat pack
On a nigga for nothin' at all
Ice Cube'll go stupid when I'm full of eight ball
I might stumble, but still won't lose
Now I'm dressed in the county blues
Wait a minute, wait a minute, cut this shit!
(
What we're gonna do right here is go back
)
(
Way back
)
""As we go a lil' somethin' like this — hit it!""
Here's a little gangsta, short in size
A t-shirt and Levi's is his only disguise
Built like a tank, yet hard to hit
Well, I'm Eazy-E, the one they're talkin' about
Nigga tried to roll the dice and just crapped out
I creeped away real slow and jumped in the six-fo'
With the (diamond in the back, sun-roof top)
Diggin' the scene with the gangsta lean
'Cause I'm the E, I don't slang or bang
I just smoke motherfuckers like it ain't no thang!
And all you bitches, you know I'm talkin' to you
""We wanna fuck you, Eazy!""
 I wanna fuck you too!
Because, you see, I don't really take no shit
So let me tell ya motherfuckers who you fuckin' with
Gangsta! Gangsta! That's what they yellin'
It's not about a salary, it's all about reality
Gangsta! Gangsta
He'll fuck up you and yours
And anything that gets in his way
Gangsta! Gangsta! That's what they yellin'
It's not about a salary, it's all about reality
Gangsta! Gangsta

She likes to roll here in my ashes anyway
Played from the bedside is ""Stella by Starlight""
That was my heart, the drums that start off ""Night and Day""

I'm almost me again, she's almost you
Sweet music playing in the dark
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
Tell me who and I'll be thanking them
The numbered lovers of Duke Ellington
Do I owe each kiss to lip and cheek
As soft as Chet can sing ""Let's Get Lost""?
And let the good times roll
Let smoke rings from this paper, doll
Blow sweet and thick till every thought of it don't mean a thing
I got some colour back, she thinks so too
I laugh like me again, she laughs like you

And I can't seem to find the way I'm s'posed to go
And all these so-called people that I'm s'posed to know
They be the main ones, smile up in your face, but behind your back they hate
So I hope you know, you ain't the only reason I'm emotional
My tears fall like water so that I can grow
Not like I was before
Tryna make a change, I need something more
I can't hold back these tears, let me cry
They say a man ain't supposed to cry
So I'ma let the song cry
I'ma let my soul cry through these words
I need to try to free my mind
Sometimes I need to cry just to ease my hurt
But when I let the song cry
Hope you don't think I still won't ride for mine
Every rose needs the rain sometimes
But know that you can dry your eyes this time
Let the song cry
What am I s'posed to do?
Hold it all together when I think of you?
When in my heart I'm thinking you were gone too soon
May you rest in peace, yet I can't sleep
'Cause my point of view
Got me in a state of mind, I'm so confused
Crying raindrops so that I can bloom
So what am I to do?

I may be cryin' now but I'll be laughin' later
Knew it wouldn't be easy when you're tryna be the greatest
That ever did it or does it
Ain't no fuckin' time for later
And I know they think I'm sporadic
The bastard child of an addict
But I'm way too calculated
I try to love, but I never knew it
This money, I'm blowin' through it
Ain't rockin' red or blue, I'm unafilliated
'Cause my bloods and my cousins hate me
I try to buy my mama's love, she don't appreciate it
So I stay inebriated

Ra—
Two trailer-park girls go round the outside
Round the outside, round the outside
Two trailer-park girls go round the outside
Round the outside, round the outside
Woo (Ooh, ooh)
Guess who's back, back again?
Shady's back, tell a friend
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back
I've created a monster
'Cause nobody wants to see Marshall no more, they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well, if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump-start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not cooperating
When I'm rockin' the table while he's operating (Hey)
You waited this long, now stop debating
'Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They tried to shut me down on
MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that, cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready, 'cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits (Fuck you, Debbie)
Now, this looks like a job for me
So, everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So, everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed, their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feelin' like prisoners, helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, ""Bitch""
A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, pollutin' the airwaves
A rebel
so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissin' my ass
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass, you asked for me?
Well, I'm back, da-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in,
the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?
Now, this looks like a job for me
So, everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So, everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
A tisket, a tasket, I'll go tit-for-tat wit'
Anybody who's talkin', ""This shit, that shit""
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You thirty-six-year-old bald-headed fag, blow me
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno
Now, let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I've been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But, sometimes, the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene
Though I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do Black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy (Hey)
There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'd be so empty without me
Now, this looks like a job for me
So, everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So, everybody, just follow me
'Cause we need a little controversy
'Cause it feels so empty without me

You dig?

I won't fail, but a lot of men will

there is too much to lose
I just wanna be famous, but...
Be careful what you wish for
I stuck my dick in this game like a rapist
They call me Slim Roethlisberger
I go berserker than a fed-up post office worker
I murk her with a Mossberg,
For a gangster, you sure did shit your pants
When you saw the chainsaw get to waving like a terrible towel
Get your brains blown out, that's what I call blowin' your mind
When I come back, like nut on your spine
Now here I come, screaming ""Attack!"" like I just stepped on one
defiance, giant scrotum
He's so out cold, he's knocked out at the South Pole
rigor mortis and post mortem
He's dyin' of boredom
Take your best rhymes, record 'em, then try to thwart him
He'll just take your punch lines and snort 'em
Shit-stained drawers, you gon' fuck with a guy
Who licks the blades of his chainsaws
While he dips 'em in P.F. Chang's sauce?
Game's up, homie, hang it up like some crank calls
You think I'm backin' down?
You must be out of your dang skulls; I'm almost famous
I have been changing faces
there is too much to lose
I just wanna be famous, but...
Be careful what you wish for
[Verse 2: Eminem]
I'm back for revenge, I lost a battle, that ain't happenin' again
I'm at your throat like strep, I step, strapped with a pen
Metaphors wrote on my hand, some are just stored in my memory
Some I wrote on a napkin, I do what I have to to win
Pullin' out all stops
any who touch a mic prior's
Not even Austin Powers, how the fuck are they Mike Myers?
Now get off my dick! Dick's too short of a word for my dick
Get off my antidisestablishmentarianism, you prick!
Don't call me the Champ, call me the Space Shuttle Destroyer
I just blew up the Challenger; matter fact, I need a lawyer
I just laced my gloves with enough plaster to make a cast
Beat his ass naked and peed in his corner like Verne Troyer
Y'all are Eminem backwards: you're Mini Mes
See, he's in a whole nother weight class
He's slugs, you're BBs: you're bean-bag bullets
You're full of it, you were dissin' his CD's
Laughed at
Infinite, n
ow he's back like someone pissed in his Wheaties
No peace treaties, he's turned into a beast
His new
Slim Shady EP
's got the attention of the mighty D.R.E
He's almost famous
I have been changing faces
there is too much to lose
I just wanna be famous, but...
Be careful what you wish for
He ain't givin' them shit, he says he'll pinch a penny so hard
He'll leave a bruise on the bronze so dark you can see the mark
With the scars, 'til Abraham Lincoln is screamin' out, ""Ahh!""
These metaphors and similes ain't similar to them, not at all
If they don't like it, they can all get fucked
Instead of suckin' him off
They can go get a belt or a neck tie to hang themselves by
Like David Carradine, they can go fuck themselves and just die
The bullies become bullied, and pussies get pushed
Then they better pull me, take me back to 9th grade to school me
'Cause I ain't lookin' back, only forward, this whole spot blowin'
And while I'm bein' poetic, let me get it stoic and raise the bar
Higher than my opinion of these women's been lowered
there's a cold wind blowin'","i have been changing faces
there is too much to lose
i just want to be famous but
be careful what you wish for
i stuck my dick in this game like a rapist
they call me slim roethlisberger
i go berserker than a fedup post office worker
i murk her with a mossberg
for a gangster you sure did shit your pants
when you saw the chainsaw get to waving like a terrible towel
get your brains blown out that is what i call blowin your mind
when i come back like nut on your spine
now here i come screaming attack like i just stepped on one
defiance giant scrotum
he is so out cold he is knocked out at the south pole
rigor mortis and post mortem
he is dyin of boredom
take your best rhymes record them then try to thwart him
he will just take your punch lines and snort them
shitstained drawers you gon fuck with a guy
who licks the blades of his chainsaws
while he dips them in pf changs sauce
games up homie hang it up like some crank calls
you think i am backin down
you must be out of your dang skulls i am almost famous
i have been changing faces
there is too much to lose
i just want to be famous but
be careful what you wish for

You feelin' good about yourself right now, huh?
Satisfy this hung-you
 (Yeah, 6ix)
L-O-G-I-C, I'm feeling free, I'm finna bring it now
Like, la-di-da-di, who got the keys to my Audi?
Last time I said it went viral, ""I don't fuck with nobody""
And I don't fuck with you, you, them, her and him too
'Cause don't none of y'all know a fucking thing 'bout what I been through
Like the pussy, don't push me
I ain't no killer, but you know the rest
You think I caught the holy spirit how I'm feelin' blessed
It ain't no ""S"" on my chest but I'm still gunnin'
Like goddamn, I'm the motherfuckin' man
Used to call you a hater, you a motherfuckin' stan
Ain't nobody built himself a brand like me
I ain't signed a shoe deal 'cause I'm waitin' for Nike
To recognize all these youngins wanna be just like me
Cut the check for twenty million right now and we might see
Everybody rockin' my kicks, preachin' positivity

When shit rough I get tough and when I'm beaten to the ground
I get up, I get up

Never address me as ""Robert"" 'less it's 'bout that Dinero
Far from a hero, I ain't never saving hoes
I'm not defined by these clothes, and zeros
It don't matter if you got six dollars or six figures on the creep
'Cause in the end we all six feet deep
Meanwhile, I'll be immortalized on a 6ix beat
Flashbacks of havin' visions way back in G'Burg
Every single one of my homies and me work
Cuttin' had to get up out it, make a hit, forget about it
Youngin' wit' a dream but nobody gave a shit about it
Ten years later, pick up the pen, write a hit about it
And back then, I thought I'd be defined by how good I rhyme
Not like these rappers with shit flows, but look good online
Not made to feel bad for speakin' bout this shit on my mind
Or called a faggot, a nig
ger, a cracker who wish he was blacker
I wish I could face my homophobic, racist attacker
And smack the shit outta they ass as peaceful as possible
It's highly improbable, it's stoppable

Wash my hands of this negativity, word to Three Stacks
So fresh, so clean, who the illest on the scene?

Open your mental, get out your feelin's like dental
Fuck a rap beef, I promise I want all of y'all to prosper
But deep down you know it's only gon' be one Mufasa
I'm the king, fuck the bling, but just might make you kiss the ring
All these rappers I came up on, I surpassed, I know it sting now
Dropped my last shit, the whole wide world applauded it
I'm heartless like Kanye in '08
Yeah, that's word to NO I.D, now they all know who I be
I'm callin' out Jay-Z to jump up on the track with me and smack the whole industry

And her girl tryna give it up

No sports bra, let's keep it bouncin'

Tay Keith, fuck these niggas up

Prada and Gucci, it don't go together
Louis and Dior, I swear it go better
Kilani gang, I swear he go wetter
The bezel is Tiffany stamped
I know that I came with a slide from left to right, but now I don't wanna dance
Nike don't pay me to tell you, ""Just do it""
They pay me to show you I'll do it again
You know how October get hot (You know)
Might make this glizzy go pop (Bang)
I thought about letting her go (I did)
But I wasn't over the top
I know that I came with a slide from left to right, but now I don't wanna dance
Cannot depend on the man
I slide her some bread in a jam, that's just who I am
Customs just wavin' at us from the window
They don't even come on the plane when we land
Anyone else would retire, but I'm not content
I wanna bury these niggas like twenty feet down so no one can find them again
Got a verse from the boy and it leaked (Fuck)
He sent me a new one, said use it instead (Use it)
I didn't even know 'bout Goyard (I didn't)
BM text me, throw ten at her like Messi
Told Kilani I want grills like Nelly's
I know that I came with a slide from left to right, but now I don't wanna dance

When I don't know the full definition of a rap image?
I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it
Institutionalized, I keep runnin' back for a visit, hol' up
Get it back
I said I'm trapped inside the ghetto and I ain't proud to admit it
Institutionalized,
I could still kill me a nigga, so what?
If I was the president
I'd pay my mama's rent
Free my homies and them
Bulletproof my Chevy doors
Lay in the White House and get high, Lord
Whoever thought?
Master, take the chains off me!

Quid pro quo, somethin' for somethin', that's the obvious
Oh shit, flow's so sick, don't you swallow it
Bitin' my style, you're salmonella poison positive
Milk the game up, never lactose intolerant
The last remainder of real shit, you know the obvious
Me, scholarship? No, streets put me through colleges
Be all you can be, true, but the problem is
Dream only a dream if work don't follow it
K Dizzle will do it for you, my niggas think I'm a god
Truthfully all of 'em spoiled, usually, you're never charged
But somethin' came over you once I took you to them fuckin' BET Awards
You lookin' at artistses like they're harvestses
""Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, boy
Shit don't change until you get up and wash yo' ass, nigga
Oh now, slow down""
And once upon a time, in a city so divine
Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga
He was five-foot somethin', God bless the kid
Took his homies to the show and this is what they said:
""Fuck am I 'posed to do when I'm lookin' at walkin' licks?
whips
The private jets and passport, presidential glass floor
Gold bottles, gold models, givin' up the ass for
Instagram flicks, suckin' dick, fuck is this?
My defense mechanism tell me to get him
Quickly because he got it
It's a recession, then why the fuck he at King of Diamonds?
No more livin' poor, meet my four-four
When I see 'em, put the per diem on the floor
Now Kendrick, know they're your co-workers
But it's gon' take a lot 'fore this pistol go cold turkey
Now I can watch his watch on the TV and be okay
But see I'm on the clock once that watch landin' in LA

And once upon a time, in a city so divine
Called West Side Compton, there stood a little nigga
He was five-foot something, dazed and confused
Talented but still under the neighborhood ruse
You can take your boy out the hood

Took his show money, stashed it in the mozey wozey

465,Adaptation,The Weeknd,2013,713283,https://genius.com/The-Weeknd-Adaptation-lyrics,"When the sun comes up, you're searching for a love
So your heart won't lead you to anyone
When the sun goes down, I know what you become
You become awake, unlike the rest of us
[Sample]
The afternoon has gently passed me by
The evening spreads its sail against the sky
Waiting for tomorrow
Just another day
As I bid yesterday goodbye
I lay my head on a thousand beds
I think I lost the only piece that held it all in place
Now my madness is the only love I let myself embrace
But I chose the lie
I chose the life
Then I realized
She might've been the one
I let it go
For a little fun
I made a trade
Gave away our days
For a little fame
Now I'll never see your face
But it's okay, I adapted anyway
Adapted to these models
Who's adapted to the bottle
They take it down like water
Just to burn away their sorrows
And clean, so clean, as opposed to what I offered
Because I chose the lie
I chose the life
Then I realized
She might've been the one
I let it go
For a little fun
I made a trade
Gave away our days

Untoppable thoughts, fuckin' juggernaut that'll
Stomp you in a verse, obstacles I'm drawn to 'em
When the going got rough
Some of what I done fought through was the worst, little sissy
Who the fuck taught you how to persevere?
There ain't no situation that you ever had to respond to that's adverse
The messiest thing you've ever gone through was your purse
Yeah, I don't try like hell, then I might as well
Hang it up like a shelf,
gotta keep growin' with it, evolve
Cause you can keep throwin' shit at the wall
But you're gonna find that nothing's gonna stick until you apply yourself
Time to slip in that zone 'til I find myself
Inside the realm of the unknown and boldly go
Into waters where nobody else has gone before
Or willing to go, uncharted, feeling is so
Bomb,
I'm feelin' myself, I'm a giant
Sometimes I gotta remind myself that I am...
Now what you do is put the match to the charcoal fluid
Put the spark to it like Martha Stewart barbecuing
Ah screw it, feel like you want to hit that wall then do it
Punch through it, just cock back, put your all into it
Now you gon' take that rage and make that what you wage
Never take back what you say
If you stay strapped in your brain, engaged in a steel cage match
Ready to scrap asap
Take your fists and just ball it
Show who's big and who's smallest you're Christopher Wallace
Now picture 'em all as plastic and foam
Lays flat, where you put your dinner plates at
And set it on 'em like a placemat
And I want you to say that
Oh, step into the unknown and find yourself
You’re floating freely, no emotion
Got a fuckin’ mouth with no shut-off valve
Can't even cut off power to it, but it's what allowed
Me to come up out from under the fuckin' ground
Cause I worked my butt off now
It's a subject that I don't know how to shut up about
Cause I stuck it out
Like a motherfuckin' tongue thats how
I responded when I got shoved around
You're gonna have non-believers
But when you're beyond belief, you probably shouldn't wonder how
Get it how you live
But are you prepared to give more than you get?
And put in twice what you get back from this shit
Though what you sacrifice barely is half, never give
Rap is my shiv
But it's like my shield at the same time I wield and my knife is will
Sometimes I feel just like B. Real from Cypress Hill
How I can just kill a cypher, survivor's guilt
I rhyme like life is still an uphill climb
Ready to face any challenge, waitin'
Can taste it, it's salivation, I'm wagin' retaliation
I write with the left, same hand I hold the mic with
As I fight to the death, 'til my last breath
Manage to prove who the best man is
Prevail at all costs, be the only ones left standin'
In the end, but I ain't gonna be the only one with the advantage
Of knowin' what it's like to be southpaw
Cause you can bet your ass you'll be left handed
Cause I am","unstoppable unpoppable thought bubbles

You say you wanna move on and
You say I'm falling behind

I got the green light, I got a little fight
I'm gonna turn this thing around

The good old days, the honest man
The restless heart, the Promised Land
A subtle kiss that no one sees
A broken wrist and a big trapeze

'Cause I don't shine if you don't shine
Before you go, can you read my mind?
It’s funny how you just break down
Waiting on some sign
I pull up to the front of your driveway
With magic soaking my spine
The teenage queen, the loaded gun
The drop dead dream
A southern drawl, a world unseen
A city wall and a trampoline
Cause I don't shine if you don't shine
Slipping in my faith until I fall
He never returned that call
Woman, open the door, don't let it sting
I wanna breathe that fire again
Put your back on me, put your back on me (I don't mind, if you don't mind)

You were practicing a magic trick
And my thoughts got rude
as you talked and chewed
On the last of your pick and mix
Said, ""You're mistaken if you're thinking
That I haven't been called cold before""
As you bit into your strawberry lace
And then offered me your attention in the form of a gobstopper
It's all you had left and it was going to waste
Your pastimes consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I love that little game you had called
Crying Lightning
And how you'd like to aggravate the ice-cream man
On rainy afternoons
The next time that I caught my own reflection
It was on its way to meet you
Thinking of excuses to postpone
You never looked like yourself from the side
But your profile could not hide
The fact you knew I was approaching your throne
With folded arms you occupied the bench like toothache
Stood and puffed your chest out like you'd never lost a war
And though I tried so not to suffer the indignity of reaction
There was no cracks to grasp or gaps to claw
And your pastimes consisted of the strange
And twisted and deranged
And I hate that little game you had called

And how you'd like to aggravate the icky man on rainy afternoons
Uninviting,

484,Dance with the Devil,Immortal Technique,2001,1959899,https://genius.com/Immortal-Technique-Dance-with-the-Devil-lyrics,"I once knew a nigga whose real name was William
but for every year she was sober
Her son's heart simultaneously grew colder
Checkin' the young chicks, lookin' for hit-and-run prospects
But he understood money never bought respect
You see, me and niggas like this have never been equal
He fiended for props like addicts with pipes and needles
Ask a nigga doin' life if he had another chance
But then again, there's always the wicked that knew in advance
Devils used to be God's angels that fell from the top
There's no diversity because we're burning in the melting pot
Fulfillin' the
Scarface
 fantasy stuck in his brain
Any nigga with a red shirt can front like a Blood
Even Puffy smoked a motherfucker up in the club
Devils used to be God's angels that fell from the top
There's no diversity because we're burning in the melting pot
They drove around the projects slow while it was rainin'
So Billy stomped on the bitch until he'd broken her jaw
The dirty bastards knew exactly what they were doin'
They kicked her until they cracked her ribs and she stopped movin'
Her broken jaw mumbled for God, but they weren't concerned
And if he killed her, he was guaranteed a spot in the crew
I'm fallin' and I can't turn back
I'm fallin' and I can't turn back
'Cause he was starin' into the eyes of his own mother
His corruption had successfully changed his fate
And so he jumped off the roof and died with no soul
They say death takes you to a better place, but I doubt it
And listen, 'cause the story that I'm tellin' is true
'Cause I was there with Billy Jacobs, and I raped his mom too
And now the Devil follows me everywhere that I go
So when the Devil wants to dance with you, you better say never
Because a dance with the Devil might last you forever
Yo, Diabolic, take this motherfucker's head off!
your worship defeat the purpose
Like President Bush takin' bullets for the secret service
Show no compassion, like havin' a straight-faced orgasm
Diabolic—a one-man brigade spreading cancer plague
Fist-fuckin' a pussy's face, holdin' a hand grenade
I just had to get that stress off my chest like breast reduction
I'll resurrect every aborted baby and start an army
You're faker than blue-eyed crackers nailed to a crucifix
Arsenic language transmitted revolutionarily
I'm like time itself—I'm gonna kill you inevitably
Chemically bomb you, fuck usin' a chrome piece
I'm Illmatic, you won't make it home, like Jerome's niece
And your crew is full of more faggots than Greek mythology
Produces more digits than twenty-two divided by seven
You're like Kevin Spacey—your style is usually suspect
You never killed a cop, you not a motherfuckin' thug yet
you're never gonna make it
Like children walkin' through Antarctica butt-naked","i once knew a nigga whose real name was william

From nine to five, I know it's vacant, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)

Park the car, then we start rhymin', ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)

That Louis Burgers never be the same (Won't be the same, won't be the same)
A Louis belt'll never ease that pain (Won't ease that pain, won't ease that pain)
But I'ma purchase when that day is jerkin' (That day is jerkin', day is jerkin')
Pull off at Church's with Pirellis skrrtin' (Pirellis skrrtin', Pirellis skrrtin')
Gang signs out the window, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
Hopin' all of 'em offend you, ya bish (Ya bish, ya bish)
They say your hood is a pot of gold (A pot of gold, a pot of gold)
And we gon' crash it when nobody's home
Pick your poison, tell me what you doin'
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
(
The one in front of the gun, forever
)
And I been hustlin' all day, this-a-way, that-a-way
Through canals and alleyways, just to say
Money trees is the perfect place for shade
And that's just how I feel, nah, nah
A dollar might just fuck your main bitch
That's just how I feel, nah
A dollar might say fuck them niggas that you came with
That's just how I feel, nah, nah
A dollar might just make that lane switch
That's just how I feel, nah
A dollar might turn to a million and we all rich
That's just how I feel
Be the last one out to get this dough? No way
Love one of you bucket-headed hoes? No way
Hit the streets, then we break the code? No way
Hit the brakes when they on patrol? No way
Be the last one out to get this dough? No way
Love one of you bucket-headed hoes? No way
Hit the streets, then we break the code? No way
Santa Claus don't miss them stockings,
liquors spillin', pistols poppin'
Bakin' soda, yola whippin', ain't no turkey on Thanksgivin'
My homeboy just domed a nigga, I just hope the Lord forgive him
Pots with cocaine residue, every day, I'm hustlin
What else is a thug to do when you eatin' cheese from the government?
Gotta provide for my daughter 'nem, get the fuck up out my way, bish
Got that drum and I got them bands just like a parade, bish
Drop that work up in the bushes, hope them boys don't see my stash
If they do, tell the truth, this the last time you might see my ass
From the gardens where the grass ain't cut,
them serpents lurkin', blood
Bitches sellin' pussy, niggas sellin' drugs, but it's all good
Broken promises, steal your watch and tell you what time it is
Take your J's and tell you to kick it where a Foot Locker is
In the streets with a heater under my dungarees
Dreams of me gettin' shaded under a money tree
Pick your poison, tell me what you doin'
Everybody gon' respect the shooter
But the one in front of the gun lives forever
(
The one in front of the gun, forever

And I been hustlin' all day, this-a-way, that-a-way

Trying to give it up
I'm trying to, baby, it's tough
I guess it's my fault, I know what's up
Baby, we used to fuck
From now on, we make love
Girl, let's catch up, phone calls ain't enough
That's where I messed up, I shoulda kept in touch
Cause I ain't the type that will hit it and quit it
Even if it's mine, even if it isn't

Talk less, that's what I was on

I used to wonder, like…
If I was singing songs just to sing the songs
Or if I was singing 'cause that's what the bitches wanted
I couldn't play guitar like Van Halen
Had no secret chords like Saint David
But you still came around, ate your lunch with me
Used to park your car to try the bus with me
But I would say, ""Girl, don't be dumb—
I'm riding shotgun""
We could go to my house after school
After school, after school
'Cause my dad don't clock off 'til late
Off 'til late, off 'til late
Looking through my whole vinyl collection
And you could teach me how to slow dance or something
And I'ma give you chills, harmonizing to
Otis,
Isley,
Marvin
And every time somebody ask me
If I sing songs to get at women
I say, ""Yeah,"" they say, ""No fair, no fair, it's cheating""
If I sing songs to get at women
I say, ""Yeah,"" they say, ""No fair, no fair, it's cheating""
I say, ""Boy, don't judge, 'cause, hell, if you were me…""
You'd be singin' to her

Knock-kneed, coughing like hags,
we cursed through sludge,
Till on the haunting flares we turned our backs
And towards our distant rest began to trudge.
Men marched asleep. Many had lost their boots
But limped on, blood-shod. All went lame; all blind;
Drunk with fatigue; deaf even to the hoots
Of tired, outstripped Five-Nines that dropped behind.
Gas! GAS! Quick, boys! – An ecstasy of fumbling,
Fitting the clumsy helmets just in time;
But someone still was yelling out and stumbling,
And flound'ring like a man in fire or lime . . .
Dim, through the misty panes and thick green light,
As under a green sea, I saw him drowning.
In all my dreams, before my helpless sight,
He plunges at me, guttering, choking, drowning.
If in some smothering dreams you too could pace
Behind the wagon that we flung him in,
And watch the white eyes writhing in his face,
His hanging face, like a devil's sick of sin;
If you could hear, at every jolt, the blood
Come gargling from the froth-corrupted lungs,
Obscene as cancer, bitter as the cud
Of vile, incurable sores on innocent tongues, –
My friend, you would not tell with such high zest
To children ardent for some desperate glory,
The old Lie; Dulce et Decorum est
Pro patria mori.","bent double like old beggars under sacks

A-yes, yes, y'all, and you don't stop
And to the beat, Com Sense'll be the sure shot, come on
I met this girl when I was ten years old
And what I loved most, she had so much soul
She was old school when I was just a shorty
Never knew throughout my life she would be there for me
On the regular, not a church girl, she was secular
Not about the money, those studs was mic-checkin' her
A few New York niggas had did her in the park
Pull out a chair for her, turn on the air for her
And just cool out, cool out, and listen to her
Sittin' on a bone, wishin' that I could do her
Eventually, if it was meant to be, then it would be
And she was fun then, I'd be geeked when she'd come around
Slim was fresh, yo, when she was underground
Original, pure, untampered, a down sister

Did a couple of videos, and became Afrocentric
Out goes the weave, in goes the braids, beads, medallions
She was on that tip about stoppin' the violence
So easily I approach
She dug my rap, that's how we got close
But then she broke to the West Coast, and that was cool
'Cause around the same time, I went away to school
And she did stud, she got big pub
So she got into R&B, hip-house, bass, and jazz
I wasn't salty she was with the
Boyz n the Hood
I thought it was dope how she was on that freestyle shit
Just havin' fun, not worried about anyone

Once The Man got to her, he altered her native
Told her if she got an image and a gimmick
That she could make money, and she did it like a dummy
Now I see her in commercials, she's universal
She used to only swing it with the inner-city circle
Now she be in the burbs, lookin' rock and dressin' hippie
Now she's a gangsta rollin' with gangsta bitches
Always smokin' blunts and gettin' drunk
Tellin' me sad stories, now she only fucks with the funk
Stressin' how hardcore and real she is
She was really the realest, before she got into showbiz
I did her, not just to say that I did it, but I'm committed
(Girl, he's committed) But so many niggas hit it
That she's just not the same, lettin' all these goofies do her
I see niggas slammin' her
and takin' her to the sewer

The future is bulletproof!

Hit the gas, kill 'em all

In the right light, study becomes insight
But the system that dissed us, teaches us to read
So-called facts are fraud
They want us to allege and pledge and bow down to their god
Lost the culture, the culture lost
Spun our minds and through time, ignorance has taken over
Yo, we gotta take the power back
Bam, here's the plan
Motherfuck Uncle Sam, step back, I know who I am
The
We need a movement with a quickness
You are the witness of change and to counteract
We gotta take the power back
Yeah, we gotta take the power back
Come on, come on
Yeah, we gotta take the power back
The present curriculum, I put my fist in 'em
Eurocentric, every last one of 'em
See right through the red, white, and blue disguise
With lecture I puncture the structure of lies
tears and fears
One-sided stories for years and years and years
Yeah, we need to check the interior
Of the system who cares about only one culture
Yeah, we gotta take the power back
Come on, come on
Yeah, we gotta take the power back
Ayo check, we're gonna have to break it
Break it, break it down, aw shit
The teacher stands in front of the class
But the lesson plan he can't recall
The student's eyes don't perceive the lies
Bouncing off every fucking wall
His composure is well kept
I guess he fears playing the fool
The complacent students sit
And listen to that bullshit that he'd learned in school
Europe ain't my rope to swing on
Can't learn a thing from it, yet we hang from it
(Gotta get it, gotta get it together then
Like the motherfuckin' Weathermen)
'Cause the circle of hatred continues unless we react

There's so much trauma in my life
I've been so cold to the ones who loved me, baby
I look back now and I realize
And I remember when I held you
You begged me with your drowning eyes to stay
And I regret I didn't tell you
Now I can't keep you from loving him
You made up your mind
Say I love you, girl, but I'm out of time
Say I'm there for you, but I'm out of time
Say that I'll care for you, but I'm out of time
Said I'm too late to make you mine, out of time (Ah)
If he mess up just a little
Baby, you know my line
If you don't trust him a little
Then come right back, girl, come right back
Give me one chance, just a little
Baby, I'll treat you right
And I'll love you like I shoulda loved you all the time
And I remember when I held you (Held you, baby)

Say I'm there for you, but I'm out of time (No)
Say that I'll care for you, but I'm out of time (Hey)
Said I'm too late to make you mine, out of time (Ah)
Don't you dare touch that dial
Because like the song says, you are out of time
Before you're completely engulfed in the blissful embrace of that little light you see in the distance
Soon you'll be healed, forgiven, and refreshed
Free from all trauma, pain, guilt, and shame

533,Bitch Dont Kill My Vibe Remix,Kendrick Lamar,2013,1268283,https://genius.com/Kendrick-Lamar-Bitch-Dont-Kill-My-Vibe-Remix-lyrics,"I am a sinner
Who's prob'ly gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me, Lord, forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away
I got
My drink, I got my music, I would share it, but today I'm yellin'
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe (
Uh
)
Look inside of my soul and you can find
Gold and maybe get rich—hol' up
Trinidad Jame$ in four weeks
But now my album platinum and shit, so what?
Y'all keep the numbers
I'm more than another statistic, my nigga
This courtesy of Compton (Courtesy of Compton)
Brooklyn go hard, motherfucker
Love me on the East like I'm Chuck D
Dominicans wish that I was born there
I'm lookin' to be the god MC
You look at my hat and see thorns there
I look at the game and see porn there
I'm fuckin' this industry hard
I'm bagging this money, tea-bagging your honey
You thought I was fresh out the yard
Don't cry to me dummy, you're a lightweight
They tell me you nice and I'm like ""wait""
Go get me a knife, you're looking like steak
And when the stakes are high, I stake out for days
And when the water reside, you're Bobby Boucher
But we ain't thirsty nigga, never alert me, nigga
I got a P89 in a suitcase
I know you heard me, nigga, this is a burpee, nigga
Lyrical exercise, right now, homie, I'm in the extra vibe
Pipe down on the curb when you heard that I got these words
To the upper echelon, that's excellent (That's excellent)
[Chorus: Kendrick Lamar & Anna Wise,
Kendrick Lamar

Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
Up in the clouds
Me and my spouse
Rumors on the ground gettin' too loud
Please turn them shits down (Down, down)
Can't hear myself think
Turbulence, shit, I almost spilled my drink
In the White House with a mink, runnin' through that bitch
Like it's my house
all up in the hall like a mall
Told you motherfuckers, all I do is ball
No, I don't 'member you, I don't intend to
Empty my memory bank
It's a million dollars in it, baby, Hilary Swank
Sittin' next to Hillary smellin' like dank
Presidential pardon, name one nigga out there harder than him
I'll wait
I've been in my wave like twenty years straight
I've been on my vibe like twenty years straight
Don't fuck up my high (Fuck up my high)
Nights like this, I could fuck up a pie
Still be straight (Still be straight)
Fall back, bitch, I got a lot on my plate
Don't waste my breath
I don't know how many moons a nigga got left
Back to this joint
Smokin' this shit like I'm tryna prove a point
I'm the highest, the highest title, numero uno
Kill my vibe, that's your motherfuckin' funeral
Between you and me, turn eulogy to urinals
Niggas pissed off
I ministered this generation by far
Leader of the new school
On my toes like a ballerina, who knew I'd be Black Swan?
World in my palms, ironically
I am the Globetrotters' best 'cause I didn't drop the ball
Told niggas when I was sixteen that I'd write a sixteen
To put a nigga right on the big screen
In the paddy wagon with six teens
Shoulda been in the pen but now my pen writin' with morphine
I heal niggas, touch down with more fiends
I kill niggas, audio crack,
Picture lil' ole me
Giving a fuck
for what a fuck nigga gotta say
Nigga, you never be Jay
Never be Nas,
never be Snoop nor Dre
You ain't get killed in Vegas or in a Suburban
Nigga, Puff Daddy wasn't your favorite
So many washed up with detergent
But I don't dry tears, I just aim at them on purpose
Like blah, Mini-14 like blah
Empty out another magazine like blah
I kill 'em all when they try to kill my vibe (Doot! Doot!)
I am the bad, the good god, the last the hood got
The last that would try to pass a good job
If Shawn's a black Beatle then I need a ten-second drum solo

546,Your Favorite Rap Song,Flatbush Zombies,2016,214497,https://genius.com/Flatbush-Zombies-Your-Favorite-Rap-Song-lyrics,"All I ever wanted was to be somebody
My reefer cloudy, lost to each assignment
Making beats and rhyming so proceed to find me
My speech align with ""teacher, teacher help me seek the knowledge""
But the street's is evil, we proceed to flee police and sirens
You fraudulent, I'm selling drugs
Where's the love? hit my plug
While the man is tryna cobra clutch us
Fancy nigga's stuck on a brand name
But any day it's O.E over champagne
I'm talking shit for my fan's sake
I give a fuck who can't relate
I'm arid landscape
I'm Kubrick with chemistry
You're degenerate, generously
Poor me, poor, poor me
I'm high as hell when indulging in these gorgeous women
Pave the future for boosters, I'm contributing my two cents
So I'm a nuisance
Producing and I tighten the loop, like it's a noose-sence
My crew is cool as the Fonz and you're Ferris Bueller
No time for your common coonery
Dreaming I been thugging like when Afeni conceived Pac
Flip O's a machine
Juicy like AI
break necks like Benoit
Remember me blessing you fools with my energy
My energy
Blessing you fools with my energy
Remember me blessing you fools with my energy
My energy
Blazing all these mics like show-time at Apollo
Gotta get the C.R.E.A.M
Money motivations, greens galore
New York we the greatest, these rap niggas hate us
Same drugs and same names
Been hot for 4 years
Pour another bottle fuck America's dreams
I was conceived under the rubble of the buildings
That Snoop crumbled back in 19-s-s-s-something
Inner Peace—Mind, Body, Soul; Holy Trinity
The Dark Man rides the pale horse
Down the road, the checker board
Kaleidoscope vision, my vision in vividest form
My prism is shimmering, glistening, I'm giving off
A ray of light, ironic 'cause my name comes from the dark
I am the spawn of the sin of my pops, yeah, I was taught
But I've evolved and got involved, my only flaw is that I know
My only flaw, and the earth revolves whether I am on it or nah
But fuck that, let's break the law
Gimme a 10, gimme a 9, fuck, just gimme a gatlin'
So I can crash the reunion and splatter his whole family
I ch-chew him and pew-pew him, I'm Duke Nukem
Pocket knife, clean slice, grab that M-O-P
I'm as cold as ice,
It's Fleezus Christ, I turn water to acid
My grandpa can't read or write
The cops never read my rights
Runnin' from them flashing lights like Ye when he was still with Nike
Devil's pie, the final slice, gave my life up to the mic
I channel ODB and Big and Pac before I sit and write
Acid tab and dirty sprite, I'm living the absurdest life
YSL Denim and Phillip Lim, my jeans virgin tight
Your favorite rapper bit my whole life, but he ain't serve it right
Come on dog, I got more bars than when your service right
One-ten in the stolen coupe, then I'm swervin' right
Y'all should call me Conrad Murray, the way I murder Mike

The bigger question is how the Russians did it
It was written like Nas, but it came from Quentin
At the mercy of a game where the codes is missin'
When the CEO's blinded by the glow it's different
Believe in myself and the Coles and Kendricks
Let the sock puppets play in their roles and gimmicks

And they ain't even recognize Hov until ""Annie""

552,Really Doe,Danny Brown,2016,509953,https://genius.com/Danny-Brown-Really-Doe-lyrics,"Show me somethin' I ain't seen before
That hoe want my piccolo
Smoking on that mistletoe
Make her kiss all on it
While we chop chop on them 24s
She look like a centerfold
Mouth all on my genitals
Suckin' on it like she gettin' vitamins and minerals
I be on the chemicals, she be on my testicles
Poke her with my tentacle then put her out my schedules
Rolling up them vegetables
I be fresh from head to toe, every day a fashion show
Used to tote that Calico and serve like John McEnroe
Now I sell out all my shows
Used to sell out all my blow
That was back when we was coppin' dubs to try and roll up 4
Now a nigga livin' good
I done made it out the hood
Think I'm goin' back?
I wish a motherfucker would
Yeah, they say I got the city on fire
I ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah
Really doe, like really doe
Really doe, like really doe
They say I got the city on fire
I ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah
Really doe, like really doe
Really doe, like really doe
Still wicked as Aleister, Crowley niggas know me well
For heaven's sake, I'm the GOAT, you haters can go to hell
I'ma act an ass on that donkey, let her pull my ponytail
and half the shit on my rider I don't even want, the Fanta's for us, the Henny's for the sluts (chyeah)
Givenchy bikers with the rev rips
Balmain badmon, Bathing Ape on my dick
Paid by the Bloods, raised by the Crips
Soulo Ho3 the prophecies, atrocities, exhibition
Oh yeah, now a nigga livin' good
But good could be better I wish a motherfucker would
Yeah, they say I got the city on fire
I ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah
Really doe, like really doe
Really doe, like really doe
They say I got the city on fire
I ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah
Really doe, like really doe
Really doe, like really doe
Life is like an appetite of truth and dare, I double dare ya
Life to end in vain before the end is near
See I can hear you crying
Silence sittin' in the dark
Holdin' crosses 'cross your heart
Sin is such a work of art
Watch out for the love lost
Bet a thousand, shoot a thousand
Things a nigga do for thousands
Made a million counting sheep
Gave it all to public housin'
Taking off to Abu Dhabi
Beamin' up the motor, Scotty
Talking to promoters, Scotty
Everybody know it's Gotti
Murder one, you've heard of them
The rev undid, the all day madness
Got it off the wipe it off, the evidence, the blood on mattress
Big power, big stages
My zoo cannot fit the cages
This booth is not used to fakin'
My crew just love confrontation
I moved the weight from the waitress
I chef the pot that made poison
I cooked then kicked all the patients
My bitch is way beyond basic
That's life insurance, car insurance, good pussy insurance
Ayy, look what we're enduring
Ayy, ridin' in foreigns
Ayy, K-Dot, four years, I got the same watch
But it's the real watch and that bitch fire
Speed Racer waitin' outside
The roof on it like a tank top
Countin' money, watchin' paint dry
When I'm done is when the rain stops, uh
They say I got the city on fire
I ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah
Really doe, like really doe
Really doe, like really doe
They say I got the city on fire
I ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah
Really doe, like really doe
Really doe, like really doe
Good, hood
I wish you motherfuckin' would
Listen, wish a motherfucker would, Brown
I had to put my foot down
It's like I'm popping a clutch
Your hate palpable, your jaw full of dust
You gon' keep talkin' or are we lockin' it up?
And I'm the type of nigga it ain't never been an honor to judge
You a mouse that the falcon picked up
So disrespect will get you checked like the top of the month
I was a liar as a kid so now I'm honest as fuck
And I never pass my mama no blunt
And kept my head straight
Listen deadweight never been a problem to dunk
Look, I just broke up with my bitch cause we ain't argue enough
I keep it dirty as a spliff my uncle Alchemist puff
I strike a birdie on 'em, while I hit your mouth with the club
I wake up early on 'em, gettin' out the house is a must
It's like a sweaty pit, sweaty sick, countin' your dubs
Either that or you gon' catch me on a mountain with monks

559,Campaign Speech,Eminem,2016,807005,https://genius.com/Eminem-Campaign-Speech-lyrics,"Jumped out of the 2nd floor of a record store
With a Treacherous Four cassette and a cassette recorder
In Ecuador with Edward Norton
Witness the metamorphosis
Of a legend growin' like an expert swordsman
From the Hessian war and
Hence the origin of the Headless Horseman
Born with the endorphins of a pathetic orphan
Endless source and reservoir
Of extension cords in dresser drawers
And deadbolts on the bedroom doors
And sexual torture kits kept in a separate storage bin
Excellent boyfriend
Use intercourse to settle scores
With women who have vendettas towards men
Dickhead is forced in 'til there's shredded foreskin
Reddish torn and they're only bein' fed a portion
Bed sores and sore shins
Pregnant whores can get abortions
Fetish for stickin' metal forks in, self-absorption
Skeletor, I went to Hell and fell a floor
A predator, I'm headed for competitors
Better warn 'em, what I lack in tact and a set of morals
I make up for in metaphors like a cosmetic store
Stegosaurus, Chuck Norris with a thesaurus
Yes, of course, a mess of warrants
You want some? Come and get some, boys!
I'm givin' Daniel Pantaleo a refresher course
On excessive force and pressure points
And dressin' George Zimmerman in a fluorescent orange
Dress and four inch heels to address the court
With a bullseye on his back, his whole chest and torso
Are left on the doorsteps of Trayvon's dad as a present for him
In my present form I'm Desert Storm
Appetite for destruction there's no suppressant for
Aggressive, forceful, and less remorseful in every morsel
Unpleasant, horrible; hello, gorgeous!
The rebel with devil horns just fell off the yellow short bus
Met a contortionist, said, ""When you wanna get sexual?""
She said, ""However I fit in your schedule. I'm flexible.""
Expired tags on the Saturn, got Catherine Bach
In the back in Daisy Dukes with the hazards on
At a traffic stop gettin' harassed, sign an autograph
For this asshole cop's daughter
Laugh 'cause I called her a brat on it
He spat on it and brought it back lookin' half in shock
Had a heart attack and dropped dead
Started fallin' back with it
And got slapped with a Colin Kaepernick practice sock
One ball and half a dick, Apple Watch
Crack front axle, walked in a Bass Pro Shop with David Hasselhoff,
pulled Tabasco sauce out of my satchel
Knocked over a fisherman's tackle box and *crash sound*
Asked if they had a laugh in stock
That was fuckin' stupid…
You got it twisted, all 'cause I offered this bitch
A doggie biscuit, you call me misogynistic
Bitch, get to massagin' this dick!
Like spas in this bitch, slob on it with gobs of lipstick
Got a shoppin' list for you to run some odds and ends with
There's not a bitch on this earth I can be monogamous with
She's non-existent
Robin Thicke with a throbbin' dick on some suave and slick shit
But I shout derogatives at bitches like fuckin' missile launches
Misfit, blond and nitwit
Like I've gone ballistic, with a frostin' tip kit
Screamed, ""I hate blondes,"" and became one, I'm optimistic
Love to start shit
Shovin' Clark Kent's undergarments in the glove compartment
Of the bucket, bumpin' Bubba Sparxxx
I'm double parkin' up at Targets, trouble causer, a double crosser
Shadiest mothafucka you'll ever come across
Olympic gymnast, been known for some assaults
A couple lawsuits, enough to cause a stomach ulcer
Same damn brain scan results as Rainman's is
Something's off, but when Dustin Hoffman's
Dressin' up in your mummy costume
On stage dancin' to ""Brain Damage,"" what's the problem?
Nothing's wrong, the name brand is back to reclaim status
Run the faucet, I'ma dunk
A bunch of Trump supporters underwater
Snuck up on 'em in Ray-Bans in a gray van with a spray tan
It's a wrap, like an ACE bandage
Don't-give-a-fuck persona, to my last DNA strand
E&J in the waistband, at the VMAs with the stagehand
She wants kielbasa, pre-arrange an escape plan
Three-inch blade on point, like a See-and-Say
Consider me a dangerous man
But you should be afraid of this dang candidate
You say Trump don't kiss ass like a puppet
'Cause he runs his campaign with his own cash for the fundin'
And that's what you wanted
A fuckin' loose cannon who's blunt with his hand on the button
Who doesn't have to answer to no one—great idea!
If I was president, gettin' off is
The first order of business, once I get in office
Second thing that'll make me happy's walkin' up to Uncle Sam
Naked, laughin', dick cupped in hand
Screamin', ""Fuck safe sex!""
Throw a latex and an AIDS test at him
Tell Congress I run this land
And I want the rubber banned, and make it snappy
Addiction to friction and static
Addict who can't escape the habit
Continue to chase the dragon
But as fate would have it, I walked up in Major Magics
Dressed as the maintenance man
In a laser tag vest and a racin' jacket
With a gauge to blast it
And sped away in the station wagon
Stacey Dash's and Casey Anthony's
Crazy asses in the backseat
Throwin' Stayfree pads at me
Dead passenger in the passenger seat
Unfasten the safety latches
And slam on the brakes in traffic so hard
I snapped the relocation brackets for the monster tires
'Finna get a murder case and catch it
Like you threw it at me encased in plastic
And send Dylann Roof through the windshield of the Benz
Until he spins like a pinwheel and begins feelin'...
Like a windmiller with a thin build while his skin's peelin'
And skids 'til he hits a cement pillar
Swing for the fence like Prince Fielder
Knock it into the upper peninsula
You wanna go against 'zilla? The Rap God
When will I quit? Never been realer
The in-stiller of fear, not even a scintilla of doubt
Whose pen's iller than Prince in a chinchilla
Or Ben Stiller in a suspense thriller
Revenge killer, avenge syllable binge
Fill a syringe, 'til I
Draw first blood
Even pop shit on my pop shit, and it's popular
Couldn't be more awkwarder
'Cause your innocence I robbed you of
It's my fingers that got stuck up
Taught ya ta not give a
Slapstick, hockey puck
The broad hunter with the sawed off
Like an arm when it's lopped off of ya
But I'm not gonna get the shotgun
Or Glock, I'ma opt for the ox
Cause I'm into objects that are sharp when I shop
And it's not a shock, I'm such an obnoxious fucker
The Rock Hudson of rock 'cause who would have thought
This much of a cocksucker to go across the buttocks of Vivica Fox with a box cutter
That was for 50, little slap on the wrist be warned
I'm unravelin' quickly
My squabbles, I'm grappling with your time traveling with me
Try and follow, as I wobble, relapse into history, with a flask of the whiskey
Tip it back then I'm twisting wine bottles
Like what happened to Chris Reeve's spine column
That's the plan of attack when I'm fixing my problems
Wish my chest wasn't having to get these rhymes off 'em
But the fact that I have so many rappers against me mind boggles
And why I haven't come back on these faggots who diss me is
More of a spectacular mystery than a fucking Agatha Christie crime novel
But my patience is wearing thin
Swear I been contemplatin' rubbing shit in your face 'til I smear it in
Diss you in every lyric until you fear the pen
And never appear again
If you actually had fuckin' careers to end
But then I think of Molly Qerim and I steer 'em in that direction and forget my ideas for them
Molly, I'm gone off you
Man, light some kush
You're my first take, I'll nail you
Can't lie, I gush
If I won you over, you would be the grand prize
I'm entranced by your looks, come and give the Shady franchise a push
You can get it in the can like some Anheuser-Busch
Jeans too small, least three pant sizes tush
Mushed against your damn side, your puss
And thighs are squished
What kind of attire's that?
I'm ready to be rode
Psychopath, bet you we'll get it poppin' like a flat
Light the match to ignite the wrath
Got knives to slash and slice hermaphrodites in halves
Piper Chapmans might just have to picket me
Like a scab
Hard to describe in fact
Startling violent perhaps
Are things that come to mind as soon as I start spitting rhymes like that
And you aren't really surprised at that
But as far as these lines I rap
And these bars, wouldn't dial it back if I star 69ed the track

it is my fingers that got stuck up
taught ya ta not give a
slapstick hockey puck
the broad hunter with the sawed off
like an arm when it is lopped off of ya
but i am not going to get the shotgun
or glock i am about to opt for the ox
because i am into objects that are sharp when i shop
and it is not a shock i am such an obnoxious fucker
the rock hudson of rock because who would have thought
this much of a cocksucker to go across the buttocks of vivica fox with a box cutter
that was for  little slap on the wrist be warned
i am unravelin quickly
my squabbles i am grappling with your time traveling with me
try and follow as i wobble relapse into history with a flask of the whiskey
tip it back then i am twisting wine bottles
like what happened to chris reeves spine column
that is the plan of attack when i am fixing my problems
wish my chest was not having to get these rhymes off them
but the fact that i have so many rappers against me mind boggles
and why i have not come back on these faggots who diss me is
more of a spectacular mystery than a fucking agatha christie crime novel
but my patience is wearing thin
swear i been contemplatin rubbing shit in your face til i smear it in
diss you in every lyric until you fear the pen
and never appear again
if you actually had fuckin careers to end
but then i think of molly qerim and i steer them in that direction and forget my ideas for them
molly i am gone off you
man light some kush
you are my first take i will nail you
cannot lie i gush
if i won you over you would be the grand prize
i am entranced by your looks come and give the shady franchise a push
you can get it in the can like some anheuserbusch
jeans too small least three pant sizes tush
mushed against your damn side your puss
and thighs are squished
what kind of attires that
i am ready to be rode
psychopath bet you we will get it poppin like a flat
light the match to ignite the wrath
got knives to slash and slice hermaphrodites in halves
piper chapmans might just have to picket me
like a scab
hard to describe in fact
startling violent perhaps
are things that come to mind as soon as i start spitting rhymes like that
and you are not really surprised at that
but as far as these lines i rap
and these bars would not dial it back if i star ed the track
why am i such a dick","['jumped', 'floor', 'record', 'store', 'treacherous', 'four', 'cassette', 'cassette', 'recorder', 'ecuador', 'edward', 'norton', 'witness', 'metamorphosis', 'legend', 'growin',

Chi city! Chi city!
I'm comin' home again
Do you think about me now and then?
(Yeah)
I met this girl when I was three years old
And what I loved most, she had so much soul
She said, ""Excuse me, little homie, I know you don't know me, but
My name is Windy and I like to blow trees,"" and
From that point, I'd never blow her off
Niggas come from out of town, I like to show her off
They like to act tough, she like to tow 'em off
And make 'em straighten up they hat 'cause she know they soft
And when I grew up, she showed me how to go downtown
In the nighttime, her face lit up, so astoundin'
I told her in my heart is where she'll always be
She never messed with entertainers 'cause they always leave
She said, ""It felt like they walked and drove on me""
Knew I was gang affiliated, got on TV and told on me
I guess that's why last winter she got so cold on me
She said, ""Ye, keep makin' that, keep makin' that platinum and gold for me""

Do you think about me now and then?
'Cause I'm comin' home again

Do you think about me now and then?
Do you think about me now and then? Oh!
Now I'm comin' home again
But if you really cared for her
Then you wouldn't've never hit the airport to follow your dreams
Sometimes, I still talk to her
But when I talk to her, it always seems like she talkin' 'bout me
She said, ""You left your kids, and they just like you
They wanna rap and make soul beats just like you
But they just not you,"" and I just got through
Talkin' 'bout what niggas tryin' to do just not new
Now everybody got the game figured out all wrong
I guess you never know what you got 'til it's gone
I guess that's why I'm here and I can't come back home
And guess when I heard that? When I was back home
Reach for the stars, so if you fall, you land on a cloud
Jump in the crowd, spark your lighters, wave 'em around
If you don't know by now, I'm talkin' 'bout Chi-Town
Baby, do you remember when
Fireworks at Lake Michigan? Oh!
Now I'm comin' home again
-Min' home again

Brothers front, they say, ""The Tribe can't flow""
But we've been known to do the impossible like Broadway Joe, so

But here's the real scoop
I'm all that and then some, short, dark, and handsome
Bust a nut inside your eye to show you where I come from
I'm vexed, fumin', I've had it up to here
My days of payin' dues are over, acknowledge me as in there (
Yeah!

Head for the border, go get a taco
Watch me wreck it from the jump street, meanin' from the get-go

East coast stompin', rippin', and rompin'

And you know I know that's a bunch of snow
The beat is so butter, peep the slow cutter
As he utter the calm flow (""Your mother—""), don't talk about my moms, yo
Sometimes he rhyme quick, sometimes he rhyme slow

Spot hot tracks like spot a pair of fat asses
Shots of the scotch from out the square shot glasses
And he won't stop 'til he got the masses
And show 'em what they know not through flows of hot molasses

And you know it like a poet, like baby doll

(Psst, hahaha, over here)
Looking at me, so I ask
You’re crazy! I like you, but you’re crazy
Never that, my mind's for sure shady
Pure Hades,
Rev X said that he couldn’t endure to save me
Why do I let this stripper burn me on my arm with a cigarette in the same spot ten times in a row?
When I felt that burn,
Maybe she never let a fine nigga stare at her breasts
Strange Lane
I like fire on my skin, blood on my draws
From up on her walls, I’m sufferin', I’m stuck in her claws
Stuffed in her jaws, huffin' and puffin', hollerin', I'm a dog
Afterwards I like really hot scaldin' water on my balls
Heck, if I was sane I would've put down the mic
And said, ""Fuck it, I'll never rise to fame.""
But with the wicked wreckage I contain
I could probably jeopardize your name
Sorry, that ain't very merry to say
Why is this game so scary to play?
Pause a minute, I'm stressin' again
If I go to Hell, then Heaven's to blame
I don’t mean to come off crazy
But you mothafuckas seem to think I’m hella deranged
When I was seven years old
I fell on my head and I severed my brain
You think I’m lyin'? Then ask my mama
Nigga, she'll go tell you the same—
Should I be ashamed? No
I’m livin' my life so ghetto fabulous
I stab you with this mic, and rap this verse I'm rappin' to you
I am not no fuckin' jacket with no matchin' shoes
And you are not no fashion guru
Matter of fact, act like I'm rappin' to you
If that gives you passion to use this as an excuse
Then just jump up out of conclusion
That I'm attackin' you dudes; it's just like old-fashion voodoo
Babysittin'
little bastards
You can call me psychotic, but it’s more like schizophrenic
And I can't sleep, can anyone tell me
Just where my medicine is?
Guess I gotta show these minors just what my avenue is
Damn it, Bobby boy! What in the hell?
What in the heaven? What in the Earth?","i see you looking at me

The beach is a good place to pick up girls
Because you can really see what you're getting
Most beaches are— of chicks
And they’re— and they're— and they're— and they’re— and they're
And they're— and they're— and they're
I've been moving in backward directions
During astral projections
I plaster my ass on the wall for attention
I need faster connections
Past is regret, eye flash from the gemses
If I didn't care what my friends did
Friends that pretend, wanna end when you get bit
Ends with a sniff or a huff or injection
I can't handle rejection
Stand my reflection, damn, no one gets it
Should I be kind or remind that I’m weak?
So I fall more behind every week
I’m the 'shine when the guys take a peek
I cry from my eyes to my feet
Stairs to the streets, to the gutters, to the sea
When I mutter in my sleep
I say, ""Mother never weep,"" my brother finds blood
I say, ""Shut up ’fore she sees,"" another motherfuckin' trap
Won-wonder will she weep, won-wonder where she be
Thunder on my teeth, spittin' natural disasters
God told me, ""Cat, don't mess with the past tense
You’re testin' the masters""
So guess what the fact is? My ex is a bachelor
this Hennessy is cursed
Someone hexed all the bottles (
Someone

But in my eyes, I can fly

595,Is There More,Drake,2018,584186,https://genius.com/Drake-Is-There-More-lyrics,"Only problems I do are math problems with profit
Only cryin' I do is cryin' from laughin' 'bout it
Only lackin' I can do is my lack of responses
Only rest that I do is, ""Where the rest of my commas?""
Still I rise, Maya Angelou vibes
When life comin' at you from all angles and sides
Love certain ones but never get attached to 'em
Give 'em nice things, but what's that to 'em?
Especially when another girl I flew in is flickin' up in my bathroom
And they recognize the bathroom
I would rather lose my leg than lose they respect
I'm in control of my destiny, never in doubt
Houston women I wine-and-dine and take to the house
My moral compass is janky, it breaks in the South
Sweeter the berry, the blacker the juice
Too many Walt Disney characters, mouses and goofs
I mean, you know I love a challenge, but challenged by who?
My peers are a talented group
But even if you take all they statistics and carry the two
Even if you rounded up the numbers and rounded the troops
There's still nothin' they could really do
It's too bad reality checks don't cover the balances due
Yeah, soon as this album drop I'm out of the deal
In the house playin' D'Angelo, ""How Does It Feel?""
Is there more to life than goin' on trips to Dubai?
Passion, instant
Sweat beads, feel me (Feel me)
Cupid's shot me
My heartbeat's racing (My heartbeat's racing)
Tempt me, drive me (Tempt me)
It feels so exciting
Thought of highly (Highly)
It's yours entirely
I'll be, I'll be more than a lover
More than a woman
More than a lover for you","only problems i do are math problems with profit

Got so many chains they call me Chaining Tatum

And I like to finish what you think you started

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, I'm good
(We back and we back and we back)
So good (And we back and we back and we back and we back)
Even better than I was the last time
Rap just make me anxious, and acid made me crazy
Them squares just made me looser and that wax just made me lazy
And I still make this song, and I'ma make another
If you ever actually hit me, better watch out for my brother
Better bet I'd take that deal, gotta watch out for my mother
Get a watch with all that glitters, come in clutters, different colors
Ben-a-Baller, Benford, butlers, chauffeurs, hit a stain-er, did I stutter?
Did a ton of drugs and did better than all my Alma mater
Motherfucker money dance, hundreds xan, gallon lean
Make a joke 'bout Leno's hair then piggyback on Fallon's spleen
Balancing on sporadicity and fucking pure joy
Nightly searches for a bed and I just came off tour with Troy
But I can't complain, I got some motherfucking bitches
How many lab partners have I fucked since I got suspended?
Mr. Bennett, you done did it, you did it, you did it
You did a good ass job, you did a good ass job, and I'm good, igh

Flip a bird, pigeon, plane, it's a word, it's a shame
But God I'm good, swear I couldn’t be better
Kicking dirt on the shirts of the lames
Keep a tab on my exes, keep some X on my tongue
Keep my work out in Texas, that's just me flexin' my lungs
See them showin' they teeth, that's just them flappin' they gums
If they bite and I'm snappin', clap clap, collapsing they lungs

Magical word (Poof), please say ""Kadabra""

Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
But loving him was red

Loving him was red

Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song

Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Whoa)
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
But loving him was red

I know she's playing with me
That's okay 'cause I've got no self-esteem

We make plans to go out at night
I wait 'til two, then I turn out the light

If she keeps it up, I just might tell her so

Then I wonder why she sleeps with my friends
When she's saying, oh, that I'm like a disease
Then I wonder how much more I can spend
Well, I guess I should stick up for myself
But I really think it's better this way
The more you suffer
The more it shows you really care
Right? Yeah
Now I'll relate this little bit
It happens more than I'd like to admit
Late at night, she knocks on my door
She's drunk again and looking to score
[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I know I should say no
But it's kind of hard when she's ready to go
I may be dumb, but I'm not a dweeb
I'm just a sucker with no self-esteem

i wait til two then i turn out the light
this rejections got me so low
if she keeps it up i just might tell her so

it happens more than i would like to admit
late at night she knocks on my door
she is drunk again and looking to score

Anger is restless
Don't hold it against us, we're alright
A celebration that lasts eternally
I'm always watching
Because somebody purple murdered me

If Lord giveth, a mil' and a MILF light skinneded
That Anvil Neidhart minus bright knickers
Maybe not quite the star but my heart's in it
When Bret Hart meet Brett Farve
A sharpshooter well exceeding any figure four
You see my figure more or less six or more
I invest in my larynx and lungs and this voice I project
My project is like what pros inject
It's ironic they call me a fresh breath
No joke, you see them boys sign me to the scope, right?
I phone home to the real they wanna know just how it feel
Who woulda thought a lil nigga from the Ville
could get a deal?
Now all I wanna do is ball on TV, need ESPN
at dinner with Hov
Hoping that he pass the baton, he just passed the Patron
I yearn
For that living large
but mama I ain't done yet
Sit back and watch your sunrise, kick back and know your son set
Nas told me life's a bitch
Pac said fuck the world and I ain't come yet
you up yet
Another day up in my ES, wish it was an LS
But elastic is my wallet, fuck it
I don’t be stressed like relaxed, muscles
Your feedback ain't plusing, and you can keep it running
when we not in summer
They like A-list actors, they not no stunners
Leave it like a female vagina punctu-
Waiting
Peep me how I'm raising up the capital from Nathan
Capital I'm raising like I'm through punctuating
Or shift keys or an I placement cause
Shifted keys gets your capital raised up","like shaun living thinking hmm

Dear diary, what a day it's been
Dear diary, it's been just like a dream
Illuminati tryna read my mind with a eagle eye
And the haze got me thinkin', why
We killed Osama and plenty innocent people died
We should see the signs, but we Stevie blind
No disrespect to the man or the legend
but
I'm sick and tired of askin' my brethren if
It all ends in 2011
Would God come through or would he actually forget us?
'Cause, apocalypse is getting closer
But they're more focused on our lil' youth sippin' soda
Fuck the sugar act, niggas out pushin' crack
And I lost my father figure because of that

No lightnin',

And after the violence, a moment of silence
'Cause I want mine the fast way
The ski mask way, lookin' for a fast pay
And instead of stickin' up for each other
We pickin' up guns and stickin' up our brothers
And I won't stop 'til Reagan is caged in
Mom tell me I should let the Lord handle it
The arm of the law is tryin' to man-handle us
A man's world, but a white man's planet
And the doors are slowly closin' while we fallin' through the cracks of it
It's a shame that flippin' crack will be
The best alternative if you don't make it rappin'
These crack-houses and trap-houses are trappin' us in
And in the end we're gonna remain stagnant

Freedom or jail, clips inserted
A baby's bein' born, same time a man is murdered
The beginning and end
As far as rap go, it's only natural, I explain
My plateau, and also what defines my name
Yeah, long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you're 'bout to hear's a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin
I used to print out Nas raps and tape 'em up on my wall
My niggas thought they was words, but it was pictures I saw
And since I wanted to draw, I used to read 'em in awe
Then he dropped
Stillmatic
, rocked the cleanest velour
Fast forward, who'da thought that I would meet him on tour
I'm earnin' stripes now, a nigga got Adidas galore
Backstage I shook his hand, let 'em know that he's the man
When he said he was a fan it was too hard to understand
No time to soak up the moment though ‘cause I was in a jam
Hov askin' where's the record that the radio could play and
I was strikin' out for months, 9th inning, feelin' fear
Jeter under pressure, made the biggest hit of my career
But at first, that wasn't clear, niggas had no idea
Dion called me when it dropped, soundin' sad but sincere
Told me Nas heard your single and he hate that shit
Said, ""You the one, yo, why you make that shit?""
[Chorus: J. Cole]
I can't believe I let Nas down
Damn, my heart sunk to my stomach
I can't believe I let Nas down
I got defensive on the phone
Resentment was in my tone, fuck it
Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you're 'bout to hear is a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin
I couldn't help but think that maybe I had made a mistake
I mean, you made ""You Owe Me"", dog, I thought that you could relate
But while I shot up the charts
You mean tellin' me that I was not up to par when I followed my heart?
Granted, my heart was tainted by my mind that kept on sayin', ""Where's the hits? You ain't got none
You know Jay'll never put your album out without none,""
And, dog, you know how come
Labels are archaic, formulaic with they outcomes, huh
They don't know, they just study the charts
Me, I studied the shows, the fans, studied they hearts
I had a feelin' I was killin', and this music we were spillin' out
Would change lives forever, fuck the label, put it out
Friday Night Lights
 blew, that was classic number two
Now it seemed as if the Nas comparisons was comin' true
Still no release date from the label, are they insane?
Gucc told me play the game to change the game
[Chorus: J. Cole]
But on the way I let Nas down
Damn, I got no one to blame
I'm ashamed, I let Nas down
But this is God's plan, you could never understand, fuck it
Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you're 'bout to hear is a tale of glory and sin
No I.D. my mentor, now let the story begin
I always believed in the bigger picture
If I could get them niggas to listen outside my core then I can open the door
Reintroduce 'em to honesty, show 'em that they need more
The difference between the pretenders and the Kendrick Lamars
And so, I took the fall
Like the son of the Lord on the cross dyin' for that fake shit you niggas bought
For the past decade
If I should pass, please let this be my last essay
Therefore I write from the heart
Apologies to OGs for sacrificin' my art
But I'm here for a greater purpose, I knew right from the start
I'm just a man of the people, not above but equal
And for the greater good I walk amongst the evil
Don't cry, Mama, this the life I choose myself
Just pray along the way that I don't lose myself
This is for the nigga that said that Hip-Hop was dead
I went to Hell to resurrect it, how could you fail to respect it?
Letting Nas down
I got the phone call
Quietly I mourned, dog, I let Nas down
Yeah, and on this flight
May I never lose sight, fuck it
Long live the idols, may they never be your rivals
Pac was like Jesus, Nas wrote the Bible
Now what you just heard's a tale of glory and sin

623,Sideline Story,J. Cole,2011,579731,https://genius.com/J-Cole-Sideline-Story-lyrics,"Tired of comin' up short—fuck abbreviated
Want my whole name spelt out, my own pain spilt out
No pain, no gain, I blow brains—Cobain
Throw flames, Liu Kang,
the coach ain't help out, so I call my own shots
I'm David Blaine, I'm breakin' out of my own box, you stay the same
But homie if you change, may you change for the better
Still loved him just enough to put up with the cheatin'
Months go by and only see him for a weekend
I say a prayer—hope my girl ain't leavin'
Money come fast so bein' hungry don't last
'Til you look in the mirror and you saw who you was
My reign gonna last like 3-4 eras
Say hello to the real, I can be your hero
Hey, I'ma put us all on the map
Gone and I ain't lookin' back
I know they gone feel it like they tank on E
I wish somebody made guidelines
On how to get up off the sidelines
Up in first class, laugh even though it's not funny
See a white man wonder how the fuck I got money
While he sit at coach, hate to see me walk past
Young black pants sag, headphones blastin'
Know what he askin', ""How did he manage?""
""With all the cards against him, he used them to his advantage!""
Slang we be speakin' probably soundin' like Spanish
Then I fuck they heads up when a nigga show manners
Some New York niggas thought it was funny callin' us 'Bama
Laughin' at the grammar cause they didn't understand us
Must've thought we slow, but little do they know
I came up here to take advantage of that shit y'all take for granted
Opportunity, that I would kill for
Lookin' at rappers like ""What the fuck you got a deal for?!""
When I was assed out with my funds low
It's nice to know I had the whole world at my front door
Hey, I'ma put us all on the map
Gone and I ain't lookin' back
I know they gone feel it like they tank on E
I wish somebody made guidelines
On how to get up off the sidelines
I made it to the rock, even though they tried to box me out
I got the key to the game, they tried to lock me out
But what they don’t understand is this is all planned
It’s a bigger picture and you can’t photoshop me out
Some nigga ask me why Jay never shout me out
Like I’m supposed to give a fuck
Don’t you know that I be out in France
Where the fans throw they hands like Pacquiao
Not cause my looks, cause my hooks could knock Rocky out
Young Simba been a lion from the start
My life like a movie, truly
And these niggas is dyin' for the part
But, you’ll never play me like LeBron vs. Jordan
Twenty years, wonder who they gone say was more important
Both changed the game, came through and made a lane
Who’s to say that who’s greater, all we know, they ain’t the same
Hey, I'ma put us all on the map

Hop on the 'Gram, flex on the bitches that be hatin' on you
Pop you a pill, call up your bitches, have 'em waitin' on you

Both in a trance, feelings are dead—what a fast life
Manager called, the lobby call is 11:30
Room full of clothes, bag full of money: call it loose change
Fumbled my jewelry, 100K, I lost a new chain
Hop on the bird, hit the next city for another M
Take me a nap, then do it again
We all woke up, tryna tune to the daily news
Looking for confirmation, hoping election wasn't true
All of us worried, all of us buried, in our feelings deep
None of us married to his proposal, make us feel cheap
Stale and sad, distraught and mad, tell the neighbor 'bout it—
Bet they agree, parade the streets with your voice proudly
Time passing, things change
Reverting back to our daily programs, stuck in our ways
Lust
Lately, I feel like I been lusting over the fame
Lately, we lust on the same routine of shame
Lately (Lately) Lately, my lust been heightened (Lately)
Lately, it's all contradiction (Lately, I'm not here)
Lately, I lust over self (Lust turn into fear)

But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
And I can picture it after all these days
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
And you were tossing me the car keys, ""Fuck the patriarchy""
Key chain on the ground, we were always skipping town
He's gonna say it's love, you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearing it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new Hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Some actress asking me what happened, you
Sipping coffee like you're on a late-night show
And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
And I was never good at telling jokes, but the punch line goes
""I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age""
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it all too well

It was rare, you remember it all too well","i walked through the door with you the air was cold
but something bout it felt like home somehow
and i left my scarf there at your sisters house
and you have still got it in your drawer even now
oh your sweet disposition and my wideeyed gaze
we are singing in the car getting lost upstate
and i can picture it after all these days
and i know it is long gone and
that magics not here no more
and i might be okay but i am not fine at all
you almost ran the red because you were lookin over at me
and your mothers telling stories bout you on the teeball team
and you were tossing me the car keys fuck the patriarchy
key chain on the ground we were always skipping town
he is going to say it is love you never called it what it was
til we were dead and gone and buried
check the pulse and come back swearing it is the same
after three months in the grave
and then you wondered where it went to as i reached for you
but all i felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame
and i know it is long gone and
there was nothing else i could do
because there we are again in the middle of the night
we are dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
and there we are again when nobody had to know
you kept me like a secret but i kept you like an oath
sacred prayer and we would swear
to remember it all too well yeah
and you call me up again just to break me like a promise
so casually cruel in the name of being honest
i am a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
because i remember it all all all
they say alls well that ends well but i am in a new hell
every time you doublecross my mind
you said if we had been closer in age maybe it would have been fine
and that made me want to die
the idea you had of me who was she
a neverneedy everlovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
some actress asking me what happened you
sipping coffee like you are on a latenight show
and he said it is supposed to be fun turning twentyone
time will not fly it is like i am paralyzed by it
i would like to be my old self again but i am still trying to find it
now you mail back my things and i walk home alone
but you keep my old scarf from that very first week
because it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
you cannot get rid of it
because there we are again when i loved you so
back before you lost the one real thing you have ever known
wind in my hair you were there
you remember it all
down the stairs you were there
you remember it all
it was rare i was there
and i was never good at telling jokes but the punch line goes
i will get older but your lovers stay my age
from when your brooklyn broke my skin and bones
i am a soldier who is returning half her weight
and did the twin flame bruise paint you blue
because in this citys barren cold
i still remember the first fall of snow
and how it glistened as it fell

634,Brendas Got a Baby,2Pac,1991,429021,https://genius.com/2Pac-Brendas-Got-a-Baby-lyrics,"I hear Brenda's got a baby, but Brenda's barely got a brain
A damn shame, the girl can hardly spell her name
""That's not our problem, that's up to Brenda's family""
It's sad, 'cause I bet Brenda doesn't even know
Just 'cause you're in the ghetto doesn't mean you can't grow
Do whatever it takes to resist the temptation
Brenda got herself a boyfriend
Her boyfriend was her cousin, now let's watch the joy end
She tried to hide her pregnancy, from her family
Who really didn't care to see, or give a damn if she
Went out and had a church of kids
As long as when the check came, they got first dibs
Now Brenda's belly's gettin' bigger
But no one seems to notice any change in her figure
She's twelve years old and she's havin' a baby
In love with a molester, who's sexin' her crazy
And yet and all she thinks that he'll be with her forever
And dreams of a world where the two of them are together
She had it on the bathroom floor and didn't know, so
I guess she thought she'd get away, wouldn't hear the cries
She didn't realize how much the little baby had her eyes
Now the baby's in the trash heap, bawlin'
Mama can't help her, but it hurts to hear her callin'
So now, what's next? It ain't nothin' left to sell
So she sees sex as a way of leavin' hell
It's payin' the rent, so she really can't complain","i hear brendas got a baby but brendas barely got a brain

You ain't running with the apes yet, apex at the Empire State neck
Hand no crown, my niggas take that
In this state of mind, gotta state facts, suspect nigga
Get your wig pushed back tonight, to 1999

Thought of the right scheme, everything else align

Eventually the dream was bought

That in every way they wanna see my life decease

The happy days of my life is now all gone

Can he see or is he blind?
Can he walk at all
Or if he moves, will he fall?

In the great magnetic field

This bed's empty without you
You said you're moving on
But I'm having some trouble getting there
But dwelling ain't getting me, uhh, anywhere
Fuckin' Valentine's Day
Fuck February, stuffed teddy bear, guts everywhere
Machete on the floor, I smashed up every mirror
Yeah, how do I look?
You fuckin' just left me here to die didn't you?
Why didn't you respond yet?
I've written you five or six different times and
I'm gettin' sick and tired of always apologizing to you
I didn't do shit to deserve what you're puttin' me through
This couldn't be true, we can't be over
So violets are blue, roses are red
Why is it everything I do I'm reminded of you?
Saw two white coffins in my dreams last night
I saw my Lord Jesus with his hands pointed toward the light
Saw my old sweetheart, she said, ""Honey, I'm back""
Just so you don't die alone, just so you don't die alone
Guess I gotta deal with the fact that, you ain't never comin' back
Now every woman that I look at I'm lookin' for you
So I'm findin' something the matter with them
Excuse to not see anyone
Useless, rather pick up the phone, not at all, followin' protocol
I get bold like bowling balls
Grow balls and go to call to talk, forget what I want to say
Damnit I'm drawin' blanks like I'm playin' hangman
I'm sick of playin' these games, I can't handle this heartbreak
It's makin' me wanna blow out my brains
Like birthday cake candles
Hang up the phone and I shake, I think I may have made a mistake
Can't escape the madness
Turn the radio on, I hate this sad song
But I can't even change the station
The same one's playin' on eight channels
I lay awake in shambles, I'm startin to hallucinate
I'm havin' all these visions of us at each other's wakes
In caskets and suddenly I wake and that's when I know I
Saw two white coffins in my dreams last night
I saw my Lord Jesus with his hands pointed toward the light
Saw my old sweetheart, she said, ""Honey, I'm back""
Just so you don't die alone, just so you don't die alone
Give me one more, bottle for the pain
Give me one more for the memories
Give me one more, I'll make it taste like a steak
It'll help alleviate
It'll soothe this ache
Of trying to fake
That she's really, she's really coming back
And it's been a while now, but I finally realize how
Much reality sucks, but it's just something about our love
I'm still in denial now, dealing with the finality of
And it's making me crazy thinking of the days we, spent
And how I'll never hold you again
And there ain't shit I can do about it
Now my head is overcrowded
With these clouded memories and I can't seem to get you out it
And how the fuck do you sleep comfortably
Knowing what you done did to me, huh?
Did it even occur to you that I loved you?
Completely, deep, and madly head over heels for you?
Was you and me, once used to be together forever
It was supposed to be us, but you crushed the dream
We was supposed to die together, and it's killing me so much
When I sleep I wake up dead, must be why I
Saw two white coffins in my dreams last night
I saw my Lord Jesus with his hands pointed toward the light
Saw my old sweetheart, she said, ""Honey, I'm back""

this could not be true we cannot be over
so violets are blue roses are red
why is it everything i do i am reminded of you
saw two white coffins in my dreams last night
i saw my lord jesus with his hands pointed toward the light
saw my old sweetheart she said honey i am back
just so you do not die alone just so you do not die alone
guess i got to deal with the fact that you are not never comin back
now every woman that i look at i am lookin for you
so i am findin something the matter with them
excuse to not see anyone
useless rather pick up the phone not at all followin protocol
i get bold like bowling balls
grow balls and go to call to talk forget what i want to say
damnit i am drawin blanks like i am playin hangman
i am sick of playin these games i cannot handle this heartbreak
it is makin me want to blow out my brains
like birthday cake candles
hang up the phone and i shake i think i may have made a mistake
cannot escape the madness
turn the radio on i hate this sad song
but i cannot even change the station
the same ones playin on eight channels
i lay awake in shambles i am startin to hallucinate
i am having all these visions of us at each others wakes
in caskets and suddenly i wake and that is when i know i
saw two white coffins in my dreams last night
i saw my lord jesus with his hands pointed toward the light
saw my old sweetheart she said honey i am back
just so you do not die alone just so you do not die alone
give me one more bottle for the pain
give me one more for the memories
give me one more i will make it taste like a steak
it will help alleviate
it will soothe this ache
of trying to fake
that she is really she is really coming back
and it is been a while now but i finally realize how
much reality sucks but it is just something about our love
i am still in denial now dealing with the finality of
and it is making me crazy thinking of the days we spent
and how i will never hold you again
and there are not shit i can do about it
now my head is overcrowded
with these clouded memories and i cannot seem to get you out it
and how the fuck do you sleep comfortably
knowing what you done did to me huh
did it even occur to you that i loved you
completely deep and madly head over heels for you
was you and me once used to be together forever
it was supposed to be us but you crushed the dream
we was supposed to die together and it is killing me so much
when i sleep i wake up dead must be why i
saw two white coffins in my dreams last night
i saw my lord jesus with his hands pointed toward the light
saw my old sweetheart she said honey i am back
just so you do not die alone just so you do not die alone","['roll', 'reach', 'gone', 'bed', 'empty', 'without', 'said', 'moving', 'trouble', 'getting', 'dwelling', 'getting', 'uhh', 'anywhere', 'fuckin', 'valentine', 'day', 'fuck', 'february', 'stuffed', 'teddy', 'bear', 'gut', 'everywhere', 'machete', 'floor', 'smashed', 'every', 'mirror', 'yeah', 'look', 'fuckin', 'left', 'die', 'respond', 'yet', 'written', 'five', 'six', 'different', 'time', 'gettin', 'sick', 'tired', 'always', 'apologizing', 'shit', 'deserve', 'puttin', 'could', 'true', 'violet', 'blue', 'rose', 'red', 'everything', 'reminded', 'saw', 'two', 'white', 'coffin', 'dream', 'last', 'night', 'saw', 'lord', 'jesus', 'hand', 'pointed', 'toward', 'light', 'saw', 'old', 'sweetheart', 'said', 'honey', 'back', 'die', 'alone', 'die', 'alone', 'guess', 'got', 'deal', 'fact', 'never', 'comin', 'back', 'every', 'woman', 'look', 'lookin', 'findin', 'something', 'matter', 'excuse', 'see', 'anyone', 'useless', 'rather', 'pick', 'phone', 'followin', 'protocol', 'get', 'bold', 'like', 'bowling', 'ball', 'grow', 'ball', 'call', 'talk', 'forget', 'want', 'say', 'damnit', 'drawin', 'blank', 'like', 'playin', 'hangman', 'sick', 'playin', 'game', 'handle', 'heartbreak', 'makin', 'want', 'blow', 'brain', 'like', 'birthday', 'cake', 'candle', 'hang', 'phone', 'shake', 'think', 'may', 'made', 'mistake', 'escape', 'madness', 'turn', 'radio', 'hate', 'sad', 'song', 'even', 'change', 'station', 'one', 'playin', 'eight', 'channel', 'lay', 'awake', 'shamble', 'startin', 'hallucinate', 'vision', 'others', 'wake', 'casket', 'suddenly', 'wake', 'know', 'saw', 'two', 'white', 'coffin', 'dream', 'last', 'night', 'saw', 'lord', 'jesus', 'hand', 'pointed', 'toward', 'light', 'saw', 'old', 'sweetheart', 'said', 'honey', 'back', 'die', 'alone', 'die', 'alone', 'give', 'one', 'bottle', 'pain', 'give', 'one', 'memory', 'give', 'one', 'make', 'taste', 'like', 'steak', 'help', 'alleviate', 'soothe', 'ache', 'trying', 'fake', 'really', 'really', 'coming', 'back', 'finally', 'realize', 'much', 'reality', 'suck', 'something', 'love', 'still', 'denial', 'dealing', 'finality', 'making', 'crazy', 'thinking', 'day', 'spent', 'never', 'hold', 'shit', 'head', 'overcrowded', 'clouded', 'memory', 'seem', 'get', 'fuck', 'sleep', 'comfortably', 'knowing', 'done', 'huh', 'even', 'occur', 'loved', 'completely', 'deep', 'madly', 'head', 'heel', 'used', 'together', 'forever', 'supposed', 'crushed', 'dream', 'supposed', 'die', 'together', 'killing', 'much', 'sleep', 'wake', 'dead', 'must', 'saw', 'two', 'white', 'coffin', 'dream', 'last', 'night', 'saw', 'lord', 'jesus', 'hand', 'pointed', 'toward', 'light', 'saw', 'old', 'sweetheart', 'said', 'honey', 'back', 'die', 'alone', 'die', 'alone']",1,1,9

Said that I was done for good and don't want no more lies
But my phone be blowing up, temptations on my line
I stare at the screen a while before I press decline
But she plants a seed and it still lingers in my mind
Told myself I'm strong enough to shake it and I'm trying
But I'm only human, I know loving you's a crime
If I take this cookie now one day I'll do the time
Slip me a xanny at once (somebody)
I got the earth in a blunt (smoke)
I get the skirt when I want (skrrt!)
I get to skrrt when I want (skrrt!)
Due to the money aroma (somebody)
My girl she got a diploma (smoke)
She got wife written all over
She got wife written all over
Run from the pain, sip lean, smoke tree up
When I'm in your town press pound hit me up
When I'm in your town press pound hit me up
Only if you down and you slurp good D up
If the work good I'll be back for the re-up
Hate when I creep and the phone wake me up
Fake like I'm sleep knowing damn well I be up
Monkey on my back and I walk a hundred miles
Guilt make a nigga feel fake when he smile
Love get confused in the mind of a child
'Cause love wouldn't lie like I lie and it's wild
Wanna have my cake and another cake too
Even if the baker don't bake like you
Even when the flavor don't taste like you
So I'm back mobbing with the late night crew
All in your mind with fears that would come true
The back of my mind, the back of my mind was you
Wishing that I could blind myself from view
And only have eyes, and only have eyes for you

What's wrong, nigga?
I thought you was keeping it gangsta
I thought this what you wanted
They say if you scared, go to church
But remember, he knows the Bible too
Now, baby, when I get you, get you, get you, get you
I'ma go hit the throttle with you
Smoking, lokin', poking that doja 'til I'm idle with you

Smoking, lokin', drinking that potion, you can see me swerving

I want you more than you know

You looked me in my eyes about four, five times
'Til I was hypnotized, then you clarified
That I (Want you)

I said, ""You crazy?""
Roses are red, violets are blue

'Cause I (Want you)
You said to me, you said your name was Lucy
I said, ""Where's Ricardo?""
You said, ""Oh, no, not the show""
Then you spit a little rap to me like this
When I turned twenty-six, I was like, ""Oh, shit""
You said to me, I remember what you said too, you said:
""My name is Lucy, Kendrick, you introduced me, Kendrick
Usually I don’t do this but I see you and me, Kendrick
Lucy give you no worries, Lucy got million stories
About these rappers that I came after when they was boring
Lucy gon' fill your pockets
Lucy gon' move your mama out of Compton
Inside the gi-gantic mansion like I promised
Lucy just want your trust and loyalty, avoiding me?
It's not so easy, I'm at these functions accordingly
Kendrick, Lucy don't slack a minute, Lucy work harder
Lucy gon' call you even when Lucy know you love your Father
I'm Lucy,
I loosely heard prayers on your first album, truly
Lucy don't mind, 'cause at the end of the day you'll pursue me
Lucy go get it, Lucy not timid, Lucy up front
Lucy got paperwork on top of paperwork
I want you to know that Lucy got you
All your life I watched you
And now you all grown up to sign this contract, if that’s possible""

Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room

So I went runnin' for answers
Until I came home","oh oh oh oh ohhhh ohh

Nuff man hate with the lies instead
Countin' cash with the phone to my ear
I feel like Meek on a private jet
Trust that, P's in the trap, disgustin'
Stick with the stick, PVA, PDA, kiss that in public

In Jamaica, quick vacation, travellin' my pastimе
Nuff pollution in the ends, I flew back yard cah I wanna see starlight
Eritrеan, skin tone cinnamon, I think I found my princess
My empress, still gonna impress

Public affection, I tell her, ""Come kiss me""
I like mine obsessed, clingy

If she don't miss me, history
If she don't miss me, it's a mystery

Don't drink, that's risky

Like, rah
And why my girlfriend never wanna see me have a good time out if she ain't there?
Seein' them stars on her private story
I dust that chick, she got no grace
Free my gang, 013's and 020's
Oh God knows, I miss my bros
I just got a call from jail on the phone and that might
Fill my heart with song
And let me sing forevermore

Hit him with the left-right, left-right, left-right-right
One jab, then I duck, then weave

Kun Aguero, man dropped the shoulder feint once
First time I link her, Nando's, sweet

Adorned with patches of places you’ve been
Is nothing on my khaki coat that I got
From a roadside when I was sixteen

I'm not a man of substance and so I'll pretend
To be a wanderer, wandering
Leaving ascetic belongings in hostels and restaurant bins
Cut that bit out *laughs*

But I keep on moving, never lose sight of it
Treating my memory of you like a fire, let it
Burn out, don't fight it and try to move on

A bandage and a wide smile slapped across my face
I'll pick up my hiking boots when I am ready
And I'll put down my roots when I'm dead

Come on, don't be hasty
You'll get that feeling deep inside your bones
I’ll be gone then when you must be alone","the cute bomber jacket you have had since sixth form

I wrote my first bars in the car with Stacy
How bizarre, my battle scars at large would lace me
Big marbles, nigga
I lead this new generation, boy, don't argue with us
Marvelous beat selectors, authors, and novel spitters
And it's all for the literature
And it's all for the hideous, the nastiest flows, the chlamydia, uh
My life is like twelve open mics of hopeless notes I write
For sure, my folks unite soon as the flow get nice
mines
Then grab Shakur right by the wing
And fly before my vocals (Scream)

Head so hard that your hat can't fit ya
Talking to the rap inventor
Spell my name right, B-I, double-G, I-E
Iced out, lights out, me and Cease-A-Leo

Women and the weed, sticky green
No seeds bitch please, Poppa ain't soft

Recognize a real don when you see one

There's this image of you and I
And it goes dancing by
In the morning and in the night time
There's all these secrets that I can't keep
Like in my heart there's that hotel suite
And you lived there so long
It's kind of strange now you're gone
I'm not sure if I should show you what I've found
Has it gone for good, or is it coming back around?
Isn't it hard to make up your mind
When you're losing and your fuse is fireside?
There's all those places we used to go
And I suspect you already know
But that place on memory lane you like still looks the same
But something about it's changed
I'm not sure if I should show you what I've found
Has it gone for good, or is it coming back around?
Isn't it hard to make up your mind
When you're losing and your fuse is fireside?
And I thought I was yours forever
Or maybe I was mistaken

it is kind of strange now you are gone

Going through your mind after such
A nasty break-up with that Latin hunk

Nick Cannon, better back the fuck
Up, I'm not playin', I want her back, you punk

Mixed with Egyptian, with a little rap and punk

You can be a permanent fixture in my lyrical mixture
Miracle Whip
when a tube of lipstick's around

Never knew I could remind me so much of my momma
I'll cut ya like Dahmer,
pull a butcher knife on ya
The size of a sword, boy, I'm like the fuckin' Red Sonja
Get it stuck in your cornea, nice knowing ya, Norman
Nick Cannon, you prick, I wish you luck with the fuckin' whore
Every minute there's a sucker born, snuck up on Malachi
Made the motherfucker suck on a shuck of corn
Shuck o', shuck o' corn, Chaka Khan

In the bed with two brain-dead lesbian vegetables
I bet you they become heterosexual
Nothing will stop me from molestin' you
Titty-fuckin' you 'til your breast nipple flesh tickles my testicles
Who's gonna see the doctor first?
I just got my one-year sobriety coin chip
When the bad get going, how bad does the going get?
Baby, you shouldn't have any trouble rubbing groins with
Each other, especially when you're joined at the hip
I'm going to get the needle and thread from the sewing kit
And attempt to separate 'em and stitch 'em back at the loin, shit
Lure the little boy with the chocolate 'Chips Ahoy!' chip
Cookie, lookie, even took me a Polaroid pic

i bet you they become heterosexual
nothing will stop me from molestin you
tittyfuckin you til your breast nipple flesh tickles my testicles
who is going to see the doctor first
i just got my oneyear sobriety coin chip
when the bad get going how bad does the going get
baby you should not have any trouble rubbing groins with
each other especially when you are joined at the hip
i am going to get the needle and thread from the sewing kit
and attempt to separate them and stitch them back at the loin shit
lure the little boy with the chocolate chips ahoy chip
cookie lookie even took me a polaroid pic
bagpipes from baghdad
bagpipes from baghdad
what is going through my mind half the time when i rhyme
bagpipes from baghdad
bagpipes from baghdad

I knock on Dakota's door; it's locked, so I go to creep
Here comes Marshall, he's on your street
Flavor my favorite graham crackers with JonBenét Rams'
I guess a modern-day Jack the Ripper is all that I am
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
But I can hear you, my love, you keep calling me
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
I foam like a Doberman, mouth open, I overdose
Put coke up my nostrils in both my holes, then I plug my nose
My pupils quadruple in size, eyes are so bugged, I know
I put on my mother's makeup
I think I'm down to a hundred pounds
There's thunder, I wonder how come it rains, but the sun is out?
The devil's upset with his wife, they must be sluggin' it out
I must be buggin' the fuck out, but what the fuck about?
Voices are leading me up to the attic, I love my house
They pull and they tug my blouse, the sound of a music box
Comes from inside a toy chest, but what do I do? It's locked
I pick it and open it, but it's stuffed full of human parts
I dig 'til I find it, I wind it up, and the tune just starts
It's playing a song, so beautiful, and the room is dark
The moon is full, I smell a funeral, guess I'll loom in the park
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep
But I can hear you, my love, you keep calling me
'Cause when the lights are off, I see the girl's asleep

through the back door slippin'
Through the crack
The mortician of love, sent from above
Been doing this for more than a quarter-century,
Am I dreaming, is it real? Someone pinch me on the buns
Zoom in with the lens, then pan back the camera
Stand back, 'cause here comes your man Jack, so Pamela

Although we're worlds apart, you mean the world to me

What bloody man is that? he can report,
As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt
The newest state.
MALCOLM
This is the sergeant
Who, like a good and hardy soldier, fought
'Gainst my captivity. —Hail, brave friend!
Say to the King the knowledge of the broil
As thou didst leave it.
Doubtful it stood,
As two spent swimmers that do cling together
And choke their art.
The merciless Macdonwald
Worthy to be a rebel,
The multiplying villainies of nature
Do swarm upon him
from the Western Isles
Of kerns
And Fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,
Showed like a rebel's whore.
too
weak
For brave Macbeth (well he deserves that name),
Disdaining Fortune, with his brandished steel,
Which smoked with bloody execution,
Like valor's minion, carved out his passage
Till he faced the slave;
Which ne'er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,
Till he unseamed him from the nave to th' chops,
And fixed his head upon our battlements.
O valiant cousin, worthy gentleman!
As whence the sun 'gins his reflection
Shipwrecking storms and direful thunders [break'],
So from that spring whence comfort seemed to come
Discomfort swells
Compelled these skipping kerns to trust their heels,
But the Norweyan lord, surveying vantage,
new supplies of men,
Dismayed not this our captains, Macbeth and Banquo?
Yes, as sparrow eagles, or the hare the lion.
I must they were
As cannons overcharged with double cracks,
So they doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe.
Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds
Or memorize another Golgotha,
But I am faint
My gashes cry for help.
So well thy words become thee as thy wounds:
They smack of honor both. -Go, get him surgeons.
MALCOLM
What a haste looks through his eyes!
So should he look that seems to speak things strange.
God save the King.
Whence cam'st thou, worthy thane?
Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky
And fan our people cold.
Norway himself, with terrible numbers,
Assisted by that most disloyal traitor,
The Thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict,
Till that Bellona's bridegroom, lapped in proof,
Confronted him with self-comparisons,
And to conclude,
The victory fell on us.
DUNCAN
Great happiness!
That now Sweno,
The Norway's king
Nor would we deign him burial of his men
Till he disbursed at Saint Colme's Inch
Ten thousand dollars to our general use.
No more that Thane of Cawdor shall deceive
Go, pronounce his present death,
And with his former title greet Macbeth.
I'll see it done.
What he hath lost, noble Macbeth hath won.","a

The ruins of the day painted with a scar
And the more I straighten out, the less it wants to try
The feelings start to rot one wink at a time

When you get out of bed, don't end up stranded
Horrified with each stone on the stage,
my little dark age
Picking through the cards, knowing what's nearby
The carvings on the face say they find it hard
And the engine's failed again, all limits of disguise

And I convince myself I need another

You've been gone for so long
I need a doctor, call me a doctor
I need a doctor, doctor
To bring me back to life
I told the world, one day, I would pay it back
Say it on tape, and lay it, record it
So that one day I could play it back
But I don't even know if I believe it when I'm sayin' that
Hope, I just need a ray of that, 'cause no one sees my vision
When I play it for 'em, they just say it's wack
But they don't know what dope is
And I don't know if I was awake or asleep when I wrote this
All I know is you came to me when I was at my lowest
You picked me up, breathed new life in me, I owe my life to you
But for the life of me,
I don't see why you don't see like I do
But it just dawned on me, you lost a son
Demons fightin' you,
it's dark
Let me turn on the lights and brighten me, and enlighten you
I don't think you realize what you mean to me
'Cause me and you were like a crew, I was like your sidekick
You gon' either wanna fight when I get off this fuckin' mic
Or you gon' hug me, but I'm outta options
There's nothin' else I can do 'cause—

To bring me back to life
It hurts when I see you struggle, you come to me with ideas
You say they're just pieces, so I'm puzzled
'Cause the shit I hear is crazy
I can endure no more, I demand you remember who you are
It was you who believed in me
When everyone was tellin' you don't sign me
Everyone at the fuckin' label, let's tell the truth
You risked your career for me, I know it as well as you
Nobody wanted to fuck with the white boy
Dre, I'm cryin' in this booth
You saved my life, now, maybe it's my turn to save yours
But I ain't givin' up faith, and you ain't givin' up on me

To bring me back to life
It literally feels like a lifetime ago
But I still remember the shit like it was just yesterday, though
You walked in, yellow jump suit, whole room, cracked jokes
Once you got inside the booth, told you, mic smoke
Went through friends, some of them I put on, but they just left
They said they was ridin' to the death
But where the fuck are they now, now that I need them?
I don't see none of them, all I see is Slim
Fuck all you fair-weather friends, all I need is him
Fuckin' backstabbers
When the chips were down, you just laughed at us
Now you 'bout to feel the fuckin' wrath of Aftermath, faggots

It's the return of the body snatcher
In a fruit fight, I aim at your Adam's apple
Pull up in the candy car, eatin' a candy bar
And my girl eatin' a candy apple
I aim at their goozer (Baow)
All of these stones on my neck, uh
They must have looked at Medusa
Pockets Rasputia of course
I fucked some twins before
I had a Benz before, this is the sin report
This is the murder, murder, pass the burner, Em (Uh)
Your money shorter than an acronym (Ayy)
Ladi-dadi, got a bunch of bodies
I'm on the Act' again, uh (I'm on the Act' again)
This ain't a accident, uh
King like Ak-Ron
I run the trap again, you on the treadmill (Treadmill)
Never Neverland, shit came with a Ferris wheel (Goddamn!)
Ferris day off, baby, AR in the same car
Most of y'all my sons, aw, look at little JR
F12 same color Kate Moss
Uh, I'm talkin' wristin' the pot
I'm talkin' this and you not
I'm talkin' bricks and you not
I'm talkin' straight up and down, nigga, like 6 o'clock
This is the equinox, this what the people want
Somebody at the door, I heard the speaker knock, uh
I'm at your throat like Chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with, 'plex with
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah
Do me a favor, don't do me no favors
But they shoppin' at Raleys
Act Hollywood like they play for the Lakers
They fly on the latest
Crocs, alligators, say hi to my haters
You must be sniffin' that yayo
If you don't think I'm that nigga
Lil' shawty now comin' from BK (BK)
But I'm tryna come up like JAY-Z (Like JAY-Z)
I feel entitled to titles (To titles)
Fuck it, man, I want the title (I want the title)
'Cause I'm at your throat like Chloraseptic, 'septic
And you got strep, I'm too complex with, 'plex with
This shit I wrote is on some next shit, next shit
I'm at your throat, I'm feelin' reckless, reckless, yeah (Hell yeah)
Bin Laden with a pen, bodyin' again
I begin slaughterin' your men, prolly shoulda been
Ali or the Svengali embodiment of sin
Like a Saudi in the Taliban plottin' an event
In the lobby of the Intercontinental with an obvious intent
And I would not even relent up on a little
Like Osama with a bomb under the bin and down the middle
Of the Pentagon and hit a kindergartner with a rental (Stop)
Back and forth, back and forth
Like Jack Kevorkian's ass to court
""Rap mature! Why can't you be like Macklemore?"" (Huh?)
""Why you always gotta smack a whore?"" (Huh?)
It's likely the psychiatric ward's a last resort (Huh?)
Yet you keep comin' back for more
Not as raw as I was, “'Walk on Water' sucks”
Bitch, suck my dick!
Y'all saw the tracklist and had a fit
'Fore you heard it, so you formed your verdict
While you sat wit' your arms crossed
Did your little reaction videos and talked over songs
(Chill)
Nah dog, y'all sayin' I lost it?
Your fuckin' marbles are gone (Wait, Em)
But nowadays every flow, every cadence sound the same (
Skrrt
)
Brain's a powder keg, I draw inspiration outta hate
Real pain in the paper, I don't trace
But if I look strange and outta place
It's 'cause I'm an alien, that's why
I write 'til the page is outta space (Duh!)
From 7 Mile in Novara
To ""How can I be down?"", all of us tryna pile in the car (Yeah)
We shot for the stars (Yeah)
'Cause we only got so much time in this world (Yeah)
So rewind it to your high school dance to the night before
If you think you're promised tomorrow (Yeah)
Now I'm 'bout to fool again
This tune is sick, it's luminous, the moon is lit
A freakin' lunatic, a human computer chip
And I'm soon to stick a broom in the uterus of your Hooters chick
I'm losin' it, you get chewed like a Junior Mint
Show me who to rip, it's time for you to get screwed
Empty the lubricant and put super glue in it (Woo)
How many fuckin' rappers did I go through?
Dispel doubt, but you won't admit I smoked
And you was spellbound, hellbound in my snowsuit
But am I s'posed to sound like everything else out?
'Cause I don't get compared to it, only myself now
Well, I can see the fair-weather fans and sales down
But the only way I care is if I let myself down
But what the fuck have I woke to?
Time to eat the vocals and shit out Pro Tools
I know you still want me to ill out, don't you?
Hopin' the old Slim's gonna spill out, open
Fire on your whole camp with this spit, I roast you
So chill out, no, you
Hoes couldn't roast me with the shit I wrote you
Then I took a stand, went at Tan-Face and practically cut my motherfuckin' fan base in half and still outsold you
You just called my shit trash?
Thank God, I rap better when the odds are stacked

If at any time he's in a jam, she'll be by his side
But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much
But all the praying just ain't helping at all
'Cause he can't seem to keep himself out of trouble
So he goes out and he makes his money the best way he knows how
Another body laying cold in the gutter
Listen to me
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast
Little precious has a natural obsession for temptation
But he just can't see
She gives him loving that his body can't handle
But all he can say is, ""Baby, it's good to me""
One day, he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror
But he doesn't recognize his own face
His health is fading, and he doesn't know why
Three letters took him to his final resting place
Y'all don't hear me
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all (
Your way or no way
)
But I think you're moving too fast
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast
I seen a rainbow yesterday,
but too many storms
Have come and gone, leaving a trace of not one God-given ray
Is it because my life is ten shades of gray?
I pray all ten fade away
seldom praise Him for the sunny days
And like His promise is true
only my faith can undo
The many chances I blew to bring my life to anew
Clear blue and unconditional skies
Have dried the tears from my eyes, no more lonely cries
My only bleeding hope is for the folk who can't cope
With such an endurin' pain that it keeps 'em in the pourin' rain
Who's to blame for tooting 'caine into your own vein?
What a shame, you shoot and aim for someone else's brain
You claim the insane, and name this day in time
For falling prey to crime
I say the system got you victim to your own mind
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast
Don't go chasing waterfalls
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're movin' too fast
Don't go chasing waterfalls (
Don't go, don't go
)

I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all (
I know, I know, your way, hey

Black, black boy fly, black boy fly
I used to be jealous of Arron Afflalo
I used to be jealous of Arron Afflalo
He was the one to follow
He was the only leader foreseeing brighter tomorrows
He would live in the gym, we was living in sorrow
Total envy of him, he made his dream become a reality
Actually making it possible to swim
It's 2004 and I'm watching him score thirty
'Cause every basket was a reaction or a reminder
That we was just moving backwards
The bungalow where you find us
The art of us ditching classes, heading nowhere fast
Stick my head inside the study hall, he focused on math
Determination ambition, plus dedication and wisdom
Qualities he was given was the shit we didn't have
Dug inside of his book bag and Coach Palmer asked for his finals
He had his back like a spinal, meanwhile
We singing the same old song spinning the vinyl
Eleven graders gone wrong
Now watch that black boy fly
I used to be jealous of Jayceon
I used to be jealous of Jayceon Taylor when I was young
Taylor made a career out of music from writing songs
It's 2004 and I'm hearing the people roar
For the name of The Game, they line in front of the store
Swap meets, selling our mixtapes, I'm like, ""Oh shit, wait""
Don't wanna be another nigga stuck regretting mistakes
Mixed feelings was my opinion, I was defending my insecurities
A tall nigga hopped out with Jordans and a white tank top
He was top of the rap game, we was the top of the block
Regardless of where you stay, hold your head and continue marching
That's what she said, but in my head I wanted to be like Jordan
Award touring the country with money from mic recording
And shortly, I got discouraged
Like every time I walked to the corner, had them guns bursting
Nigga, I was rehearsing in repetition the phrase
That only one in a million will ever see better days
Especially when the crime waves was bigger than tsunamis
Break your boogie boards to pieces,
All these niggas facetious and they all standing beside me
They all'll buy me a chopper if any one of you try me","black boy fly black boy fly

800,44 Bars,Logic,2016,839530,https://genius.com/Logic-44-Bars-lyrics,"If you deal with war, backwards stay far
We're dealing with truths and rights
Come some more into my sight
(You no hear me yet?)
(Hear me live and direct)
(Walk with your tap
)
Yeah, in London talkin' to rhêtorík 'bout my life and shit
I thought the album was finished but I keep writing shit
It's kind of funny how life changed and rearranged
No matter what happens, everything ain't gon' be the same
The incredible album, what an incredible outcome
I grip the mic and then talk to the people like I'm Malcolm
I used to think the fame and money was the motivation
Until I toured the world and met the people face to face and
Understood that the power was harnessed in that basement
It ain't about the money and notoriety
It's about the people and making a difference in society
But don't get it twisted, this life I'm living is like a movie
The Godfather, the Goodfella wielding a Uzi
One with the people, if the people is wondering who's he?
Same level, the same rebel that never settled
Pullin' strings like Geppetto
who overcame the ghetto
And I know you wrote me and I still ain't answered
'Cause shit is different now, it's forced upon me, different stances
I used to spend all of my time conversing with you
But now I write this song to let you know I'm hurting with you
it's kinda bittersweet
Besides the shows and meet and greets, y'all only see me on the street
And even then, that shit is rare—I just don't go outside
'Cause honestly, I don't fuck with this world, I'd rather hide
That misconception, ""'Cause I rap, I must be filled with pride""
Shit, I ain't perfect, if you heard different then someone lied
People in my ear telling me, ""Talk that shit""
Actions speak louder than words, I'd rather walk that shit
Since the first album, I'm one of the highest earners on the label
Within six months, I put the second one on they table
I played sold out shows in parts of the world I can't pronounce
Release the tickets, watch them disappear when we announce
Fuck all that murderous syllable shit right now, just let me bounce
The mood around me is people smokin' it by the ounce
Leave Friday for the show and come back Monday with a hundred grand
Don't fuck with checks, so when I bounce I prefer cash in hand
You know my first week looking crazy due to high demand
There's ups and downs, don't get me wrong but back when I ain't have shit
Felt like I woulda sold my soul to make it with this rap shit
Thank God he never let Lucifer close enough to ask
Let me attain it by workin' hard and busting my ass
Achieved a lot in life, but what's a lot with more to gain?
At least I don't drink to avoid the hurt, we call that champagne

I live by the beat, I die by the beat, since 1990, I (I)
Live by the beat, I die by the beat, like MPC Akai
Who I named William after 'cause I get bills from these beats
Came up in a world that's off its axis
All that's promised, death and taxes
I'm stuck in a clinic like Flynn Montgomery
Creeping through fireside
Smash the window of that fire ride
Just to see what we can snatch from up inside
'Til the flashin' lights come 'round that corner then we run and hide
Prayin' to God up in Heaven, eleven at night and I got no alibi
My damn, dip to Stewart Town
Best not come 'round these parts if you new in town
Wonder what my homies from back in the day livin' at, are doin' now
Running with my sister Jeannie, schooling me like Mr. Feeny
Growing pains (
Three
), this the type of shit don't never stop
Here come the cops
Shooting up the hood like Black Ops
'Cause trigger-happy police tend to trigger happy people
My God, if you exist, then why you make life so hard?
If you exist, the way you think is avant-garde
If you exist, you got a funny way of showing it
What happens in the afterlife?
These people think they knowin' shit
And on that note, I keep it G
Like track four, ""Kick in the Door"" by Notorious B.I.G. 
Don't believe me, look that shit up, I promise you'll find the key
Snap my fingers like Thanos and Bobby Boy bringin' the doom
'Cause I'm 6:30, killin' shit, hands down and dirty
That white boy can't rap, he talk good and act nerdy
I just texted Erykah Badu
To let her know what I'm gon' do
Sample ""Dreamflower"" by Tarika Blue
That's cool with you?
Yeah, that's fine, baby, all gravy
Long as you know you my baby
And that beat yo' daddy like if he ever cheat on me
I mean she don't own the sample but she might as well
'Cause her and Dilla paved the way for all I got, and, well
I'ma show my gratitude, no attitude, no auto-tune like T-Pain
Doin'
Unplugged
, I'm unplugged, like Trinity
The greatest rapper alive is probably slacking producing
Introduce you to my train of thought
Snapping on a track like the illest conductor
I brought my heart to the table
Fact and never fiction, fuck a fable
Power through these lines faster than fiber-optic cable, I'm gone
You and me
Gon' live together in this perfect harmony (

til the flashin lights come round that corner then we run and hide
prayin to god up in heaven eleven at night and i got no alibi
my damn dip to stewart town
best not come round these parts if you new in town
wonder what my homies from back in the day livin at are doing now
running with my sister jeannie schooling me like mr feeny
growing pains 
three
 this the type of shit do not never stop
here come the cops
shooting up the hood like black ops
because triggerhappy police tend to trigger happy people
my god if you exist then why you make life so hard
if you exist the way you think is avantgarde
if you exist you got a funny way of showing it
what happens in the afterlife
these people think they knowin shit
and on that note i keep it g
like track four kick in the door by notorious big 
do not believe me look that shit up i promise you will find the key
snap my fingers like thanos and bobby boy bringin the doom
because i am  killin shit hands down and dirty
that white boy cannot rap he talk good and act nerdy
i just texted erykah badu
to let her know what i am gon do
sample dreamflower by tarika blue
that is cool with you
yeah that is fine baby all gravy
long as you know you my baby
and that beat yo daddy like if he ever cheat on me
i mean she do not own the sample but she might as well
because her and dilla paved the way for all i got and well
i am about to show my gratitude no attitude no autotune like tpain
doing
unplugged
 i am unplugged like trinity
the greatest rapper alive is probably slacking producing
introduce you to my train of thought
snapping on a track like the illest conductor
i brought my heart to the table
fact and never fiction fuck a fable
power through these lines faster than fiberoptic cable i am gone
you and me
gon live together in this perfect harmony 
i hear them callin

i can hear them callin me
we have come a long way since hoc 
watch

you and me
gon live together in this perfect harmony 
i hear them callin

i can hear them callin me
we have come a long way since hoc 
watch
